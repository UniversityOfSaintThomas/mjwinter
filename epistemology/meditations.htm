<h2><font size="2">MEDITATION I.<br>
<br>
OF THE THINGS OF WHICH WE MAY DOUBT.</font></h2>
</center></font><font size="2"><br>
&nbsp;<p>1. SEVERAL years have now elapsed since I first became aware that I had 
accepted, even from my youth, many false opinions for true, and that 
consequently what I afterward based on such principles was highly doubtful; and 
from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking once in my life 
to rid myself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work 
of building from the foundation, if I desired to establish a firm and abiding 
superstructure in the sciences. But as this enterprise appeared to me to be one 
of great magnitude, I waited until I had attained an age so mature as to leave 
me no hope that at any stage of life more advanced I should be better able to 
execute my design. On this account, I have delayed so long that I should 
henceforth consider I was doing wrong were I still to consume in deliberation 
any of the time that now remains for action. To-day, then, since I have 
opportunely freed my mind from all cares [and am happily disturbed by no 
passions], and since I am in the secure possession of leisure in a peaceable 
retirement, I will at length apply myself earnestly and freely to the general 
overthrow of all my former opinions.[L][F]</p>
<p>2. But, to this end, it will not be necessary for me to show that the wholeof 
these are false--a point, perhaps, which I shall never reach; but as even now my 
reason convinces me that I ought not the less carefully to withhold belief from 
what is not entirely certain and indubitable, than from what is manifestly 
false, it will be sufficient to justify the rejection of the whole if I shall 
find in each some ground for doubt. Nor for this purpose will it be necessary 
even to deal with each belief individually, which would be truly an endless 
labor; but, as the removal from below of the foundation necessarily involves the 
downfall of the whole edifice, I will at once approach the criticism of the 
principles on which all my former beliefs rested.[L][F]</p>
<p>3. All that I have, up to this moment, accepted as possessed of the highest 
truth and certainty, I received either from or through the senses. I observed, 
however, that these sometimes misled us; and it is the part of prudence not to 
place absolute confidence in that by which we have even once been deceived.[L][F]</p>
<p>4. But it may be said, perhaps, that, although the senses occasionally 
mislead us respecting minute objects, and such as are so far removed from us as 
to be beyond the reach of close observation, there are yet many other of their 
informations (presentations), of the truth of which it is manifestly impossible 
to doubt; as for example, that I am in this place, seated by the fire, clothed 
in a winter dressing gown, that I hold in my hands this piece of paper, with 
other intimations of the same nature. But how could I deny that I possess these 
hands and this body, and withal escape being classed with persons in a state of 
insanity, whose brains are so disordered and clouded by dark bilious vapors as 
to cause them pertinaciously to assert that they are monarchs when they are in 
the greatest poverty; or clothed [in gold] and purple when destitute of any 
covering; or that their head is made of clay, their body of glass, or that they 
are gourds? I should certainly be not less insane than they, were I to regulate 
my procedure according to examples so extravagant.[L][F]</p>
<p>5. Though this be true, I must nevertheless here consider that I am a man, 
and that, consequently, I am in the habit of sleeping, and representing to 
myself in dreams those same things, or even sometimes others less probable, 
which the insane think are presented to them in their waking moments. How often 
have I dreamt that I was in these familiar circumstances, that I was dressed, 
and occupied this place by the fire, when I was lying undressed in bed? At the 
present moment, however, I certainly look upon this paper with eyes wide awake; 
the head which I now move is not asleep; I extend this hand consciously and with 
express purpose, and I perceive it; the occurrences in sleep are not so distinct 
as all this. But I cannot forget that, at other times I have been deceived in 
sleep by similar illusions; and, attentively considering those cases, I perceive 
so clearly that there exist no certain marks by which the state of waking can 
ever be distinguished from sleep, that I feel greatly astonished; and in 
amazement I almost persuade myself that I am now dreaming.[L][F]</p>
<p>6. Let us suppose, then, that we are dreaming, and that all these 
particulars--namely, the opening of the eyes, the motion of the head, the forth- 
putting of the hands--are merely illusions; and even that we really possess 
neither an entire body nor hands such as we see. Nevertheless it must be 
admitted at least that the objects which appear to us in sleep are, as it were, 
painted representations which could not have been formed unless in the likeness 
of realities; and, therefore, that those general objects, at all events, namely, 
eyes, a head, hands, and an entire body, are not simply imaginary, but really 
existent. For, in truth, painters themselves, even when they study to represent 
sirens and satyrs by forms the most fantastic and extraordinary, cannot bestow 
upon them natures absolutely new, but can only make a certain medley of the 
members of different animals; or if they chance to imagine something so novel 
that nothing at all similar has ever been seen before, and such as is, 
therefore, purely fictitious and absolutely false, it is at least certain that 
the colors of which this is composed are real. And on the same principle, 
although these general objects, viz. [a body], eyes, a head, hands, and the 
like, be imaginary, we are nevertheless absolutely necessitated to admit the 
reality at least of some other objects still more simple and universal than 
these, of which, just as of certain real colors, all those images of things, 
whether true and real, or false and fantastic, that are found in our 
consciousness (cogitatio) are formed.[L][F]</p>
<p>7. To this class of objects seem to belong corporeal nature in general and 
its extension; the figure of extended things, their quantity or magnitude, and 
their number, as also the place in, and the time during, which they exist, and 
other things of the same sort.[L][F]</p>
<p>8. We will not, therefore, perhaps reason illegitimately if we conclude from 
this that Physics, Astronomy, Medicine, and all the other sciences that have for 
their end the consideration of composite objects, are indeed of a doubtful 
character; but that Arithmetic, Geometry, and the other sciences of the same 
class, which regard merely the simplest and most general objects, and scarcely 
inquire whether or not these are really existent, contain somewhat that is 
certain and indubitable: for whether I am awake or dreaming, it remains true 
that two and three make five, and that a square has but four sides; nor does it 
seem possible that truths so apparent can ever fall under a suspicion of falsity 
[or incertitude].[L][F]</p>
<p>9. Nevertheless, the belief that there is a God who is all powerful, and who 
created me, such as I am, has, for a long time, obtained steady possession of my 
mind. How, then, do I know that he has not arranged that there should be neither 
earth, nor sky, nor any extended thing, nor figure, nor magnitude, nor place, 
providing at the same time, however, for [the rise in me of the perceptions of 
all these objects, and] the persuasion that these do not exist otherwise than as 
I perceive them ? And further, as I sometimes think that others are in error 
respecting matters of which they believe themselves to possess a perfect 
knowledge, how do I know that I am not also deceived each time I add together 
two and three, or number the sides of a square, or form some judgment still more 
simple, if more simple indeed can be imagined? But perhaps Deity has not been 
willing that I should be thus deceived, for he is said to be supremely good. If, 
however, it were repugnant to the goodness of Deity to have created me subject 
to constant deception, it would seem likewise to be contrary to his goodness to 
allow me to be occasionally deceived; and yet it is clear that this is 
permitted.[L][F]</p>
<p>10. Some, indeed, might perhaps be found who would be disposed rather to deny 
the existence of a Being so powerful than to believe that there is nothing 
certain. But let us for the present refrain from opposing this opinion, and 
grant that all which is here said of a Deity is fabulous: nevertheless, in 
whatever way it be supposed that I reach the state in which I exist, whether by 
fate, or chance, or by an endless series of antecedents and consequents, or by 
any other means, it is clear (since to be deceived and to err is a certain 
defect ) that the probability of my being so imperfect as to be the constant 
victim of deception, will be increased exactly in proportion as the power 
possessed by the cause, to which they assign my origin, is lessened. To these 
reasonings I have assuredly nothing to reply, but am constrained at last to avow 
that there is nothing of all that I formerly believed to be true of which it is 
impossible to doubt, and that not through thoughtlessness or levity, but from 
cogent and maturely considered reasons; so that henceforward, if I desire to 
discover anything certain, I ought not the less carefully to refrain from 
assenting to those same opinions than to what might be shown to be manifestly 
false.[L][F]</p>
<p>11. But it is not sufficient to have made these observations; care must be 
taken likewise to keep them in remembrance. For those old and customary opinions 
perpetually recur-- long and familiar usage giving them the right of occupying 
my mind, even almost against my will, and subduing my belief; nor will I lose 
the habit of deferring to them and confiding in them so long as I shall consider 
them to be what in truth they are, viz., opinions to some extent doubtful, as I 
have already shown, but still highly probable, and such as it is much more 
reasonable to believe than deny. It is for this reason I am persuaded that I 
shall not be doing wrong, if, taking an opposite judgment of deliberate design, 
I become my own deceiver, by supposing, for a time, that all those opinions are 
entirely false and imaginary, until at length, having thus balanced my old by my 
new prejudices, my judgment shall no longer be turned aside by perverted usage 
from the path that may conduct to the perception of truth. For I am assured 
that, meanwhile, there will arise neither peril nor error from this course, and 
that I cannot for the present yield too much to distrust, since the end I now 
seek is not action but knowledge.[L][F]</p>
<p>12. I will suppose, then, not that Deity, who is sovereignly good and the 
fountain of truth, but that some malignant demon, who is at once exceedingly 
potent and deceitful, has employed all his artifice to deceive me; t will 
suppose that the sky, the air, the earth, colors, figures, sounds, and all 
external things, are nothing better than the illusions of dreams, by means of 
which this being has laid snares for my credulity; I will consider myself as 
without hands, eyes, flesh, blood, or any of the senses, and as falsely 
believing that I am possessed of these; I will continue resolutely fixed in this 
belief, and if indeed by this means it be not in my power to arrive at the 
knowledge of truth, I shall at least do what is in my power, viz., [ suspend my 
judgment ], and guard with settled purpose against giving my assent to what is 
false, and being imposed upon by this deceiver, whatever be his power and 
artifice. But this undertaking is arduous, and a certain indolence insensibly 
leads me back to my ordinary course of life; and just as the captive, who, 
perchance, was enjoying in his dreams an imaginary liberty, when he begins to 
suspect that it is but a vision, dreads awakening, and conspires with the 
agreeable illusions that the deception may be prolonged; so I, of my own accord, 
fall back into the train of my former beliefs, and fear to arouse myself from my 
slumber, lest the time of laborious wakefulness that would succeed this quiet 
rest, in place of bringing any light of day, should prove inadequate to dispel 
the darkness that will arise from the difficulties that have now been 
raised.[L][F]</p>

<h2><font size="2">MEDITATION II.<br>
<br>
OF THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN MIND;<br>
<br>
AND THAT IT IS MORE EASILY KNOWN<br>
<br>
THAN THE BODY.</font></h2>
</center><font size="2">
<p>1. The Meditation of yesterday has filled my mind with so many doubts, that 
it is no longer in my power to forget them. Nor do I see, meanwhile, any 
principle on which they can be resolved; and, just as if I had fallen all of a 
sudden into very deep water, I am so greatly disconcerted as to be unable either 
to plant my feet firmly on the bottom or sustain myself by swimming on the 
surface. I will, nevertheless, make an effort, and try anew the same path on 
which I had entered yesterday, that is, proceed by casting aside all that admits 
of the slightest doubt, not less than if I had discovered it to be absolutely 
false; and I will continue always in this track until I shall find something 
that is certain, or at least, if I can do nothing more, until I shall know with 
certainty that there is nothing certain. Archimedes, that he might transport the 
entire globe from the place it occupied to another, demanded only a point that 
was firm and immovable; so, also, I shall be entitled to entertain the highest 
expectations, if I am fortunate enough to discover only one thing that is 
certain and indubitable.[L][F]</p>
<p>2. I suppose, accordingly, that all the things which I see are false 
(fictitious); I believe that none of those objects which my fallacious memory 
represents ever existed; I suppose that I possess no senses; I believe that 
body, figure, extension, motion, and place are merely fictions of my mind. What 
is there, then, that can be esteemed true ? Perhaps this only, that there is 
absolutely nothing certain.[L][F]</p>
<p>3. But how do I know that there is not something different altogether from 
the objects I have now enumerated, of which it is impossible to entertain the 
slightest doubt? Is there not a God, or some being, by whatever name I may 
designate him, who causes these thoughts to arise in my mind ? But why suppose 
such a being, for it may be I myself am capable of producing them? Am I, then, 
at least not something? But I before denied that I possessed senses or a body; I 
hesitate, however, for what follows from that? Am I so dependent on the body and 
the senses that without these I cannot exist? But I had the persuasion that 
there was absolutely nothing in the world, that there was no sky and no earth, 
neither minds nor bodies; was I not, therefore, at the same time, persuaded that 
I did not exist? Far from it; I assuredly existed, since I was persuaded. But 
there is I know not what being, who is possessed at once of the highest power 
and the deepest cunning, who is constantly employing all his ingenuity in 
deceiving me. Doubtless, then, I exist, since I am deceived; and, let him 
deceive me as he may, he can never bring it about that I am nothing, so long as 
I shall be conscious that I am something. So that it must, in fine, be 
maintained, all things being maturely and carefully considered, that this 
proposition (pronunciatum ) I am, I exist, is necessarily true each time it is 
expressed by me, or conceived in my mind.[L][F]</p>
<p>4. But I do not yet know with sufficient clearness what I am, though assured 
that I am; and hence, in the next place, I must take care, lest perchance I 
inconsiderately substitute some other object in room of what is properly myself, 
and thus wander from truth, even in that knowledge ( cognition ) which I hold to 
be of all others the most certain and evident. For this reason, I will now 
consider anew what I formerly believed myself to be, before I entered on the 
present train of thought; and of my previous opinion I will retrench all that 
can in the least be invalidated by the grounds of doubt I have adduced, in order 
that there may at length remain nothing but what is certain and indubitable. 
[L][F]</p>
5. What then did I formerly think I was? Undoubtedly I judged that I was a man. 
But what is a man? Shall I say a rational animal? Assuredly not; for it would be 
necessary forthwith to inquire into what is meant by animal, and what by 
rational, and thus, from a single question, I should insensibly glide into 
others, and these more difficult than the first; nor do I now possess enough of 
leisure to warrant me in wasting my time amid subtleties of this sort. I prefer 
here to attend to the thoughts that sprung up of themselves in my mind, and were 
inspired by my own nature alone, when I applied myself to the consideration of 
what I was. In the first place, then, I thought that I possessed a countenance, 
hands, arms, and all the fabric of members that appears in a corpse, and which I 
called by the name of body. It further occurred to me that I was nourished, that 
I walked, perceived, and thought, and all those actions I referred to the soul; 
but what the soul itself was I either did not stay to consider, or, if I did, I 
imagined that it was something extremely rare and subtile, like wind, or flame, 
or ether, spread through my grosser parts. As regarded the body, I did not even 
doubt of its nature, but thought I distinctly knew it, and if I had wished to 
describe it according to the notions I then entertained, I should have explained 
myself in this manner: By body I understand all that can be terminated by a 
certain figure; that can be comprised in a certain place, and so fill a certain 
space as therefrom to exclude every other body; that can be perceived either by 
touch, sight, hearing, taste, or smell; that can be moved in different ways, not 
indeed of itself, but by something foreign to it by which it is touched [and 
from which it receives the impression]; for the power of self-motion, as 
likewise that of perceiving and thinking, I held as by no means pertaining to 
the nature of body; on the contrary, I was somewhat astonished to find such 
faculties existing in some bodies.[L][F]
</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font size="2">
<p>6. But [as to myself, what can I now say that I am], since I suppose there 
exists an extremely powerful, and, if I may so speak, malignant being, whose 
whole endeavors are directed toward deceiving me ? Can I affirm that I possess 
any one of all those attributes of which I have lately spoken as belonging to 
the nature of body ? After attentively considering them in my own mind, I find 
none of them that can properly be said to belong to myself. To recount them were 
idle and tedious. Let us pass, then, to the attributes of the soul. The first 
mentioned were the powers of nutrition and walking; but, if it be true that I 
have no body, it is true likewise that I am capable neither of walking nor of 
being nourished. Perception is another attribute of the soul; but perception too 
is impossible without the body; besides, I have frequently, during sleep, 
believed that I perceived objects which I afterward observed I did not in 
reality perceive. Thinking is another attribute of the soul; and here I discover 
what properly belongs to myself. This alone is inseparable from me. I am--I 
exist: this is certain; but how often? As often as I think; for perhaps it would 
even happen, if I should wholly cease to think, that I should at the same time 
altogether cease to be. I now admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am 
therefore, precisely speaking, only a thinking thing, that is, a mind (mens sive 
animus), understanding, or reason, terms whose signification was before unknown 
to me. I am, however, a real thing, and really existent; but what thing? The 
answer was, a thinking thing. [L][F]</p>
<p>7. The question now arises, am I aught besides? I will stimulate my 
imagination with a view to discover whether I am not still something more than a 
thinking being. Now it is plain I am not the assemblage of members called the 
human body; I am not a thin and penetrating air diffused through all these 
members, or wind, or flame, or vapor, or breath, or any of all the things I can 
imagine; for I supposed that all these were not, and, without changing the 
supposition, I find that I still feel assured of my existence. But it is true, 
perhaps, that those very things which I suppose to be non-existent, because they 
are unknown to me, are not in truth different from myself whom I know. This is a 
point I cannot determine, and do not now enter into any dispute regarding it. I 
can only judge of things that are known to me: I am conscious that I exist, and 
I who know that I exist inquire into what I am. It is, however, perfectly 
certain that the knowledge of my existence, thus precisely taken, is not 
dependent on things, the existence of which is as yet unknown to me: and 
consequently it is not dependent on any of the things I can feign in 
imagination. Moreover, the phrase itself, I frame an image (efffngo), reminds me 
of my error; for I should in truth frame one if I were to imagine myself to be 
anything, since to imagine is nothing more than to contemplate the figure or 
image of a corporeal thing; but I already know that I exist, and that it is 
possible at the same time that all those images, and in general all that relates 
to the nature of body, are merely dreams [or chimeras]. From this I discover 
that it is not more reasonable to say, I will excite my imagination that I may 
know more distinctly what I am, than to express myself as follows: I am now 
awake, and perceive something real; but because my perception is not 
sufficiently clear, I will of express purpose go to sleep that my dreams may 
represent to me the object of my perception with more truth and clearness. And, 
therefore, I know that nothing of all that I can embrace in imagination belongs 
to the knowledge which I have of myself, and that there is need to recall with 
the utmost care the mind from this mode of thinking, that it may be able to know 
its own nature with perfect distinctness.[L][F]</p>
<p>8. But what, then, am I? A thinking thing, it has been said. But what is a 
thinking thing? It is a thing that doubts, understands, [conceives], affirms, 
denies, wills, refuses; that imagines also, and perceives. [L][F]</p>
<p>9. Assuredly it is not little, if all these properties belong to my nature. 
But why should they not belong to it? Am I not that very being who now doubts of 
almost everything; who, for all that, understands and conceives certain things; 
who affirms one alone as true, and denies the others; who desires to know more 
of them, and does not wish to be deceived; who imagines many things, sometimes 
even despite his will; and is likewise percipient of many, as if through the 
medium of the senses. Is there nothing of all this as true as that I am, even 
although I should be always dreaming, and although he who gave me being employed 
all his ingenuity to deceive me? Is there also any one of these attributes that 
can be properly distinguished from my thought, or that can be said to be 
separate from myself? For it is of itself so evident that it is I who doubt, I 
who understand, and I who desire, that it is here unnecessary to add anything by 
way of rendering it more clear. And I am as certainly the same being who 
imagines; for although it may be (as I before supposed) that nothing I imagine 
is true, still the power of imagination does not cease really to exist in me and 
to form part of my thought. In fine, I am the same being who perceives, that is, 
who apprehends certain objects as by the organs of sense, since, in truth, I see 
light, hear a noise, and feel heat. But it will be said that these presentations 
are false, and that I am dreaming. Let it be so. At all events it is certain 
that I seem to see light, hear a noise, and feel heat; this cannot be false, and 
this is what in me is properly called perceiving (sentire), which is nothing 
else than thinking.[L][F]</p>
<p>10. From this I begin to know what I am with somewhat greater clearness and 
distinctness than heretofore. But, nevertheless, it still seems to me, and I 
cannot help believing, that corporeal things, whose images are formed by thought 
[which fall under the senses], and are examined by the same, are known with much 
greater distinctness than that I know not what part of myself which is not 
imaginable; although, in truth, it may seem strange to say that I know and 
comprehend with greater distinctness things whose existence appears to me 
doubtful, that are unknown, and do not belong to me, than others of whose 
reality I am persuaded, that are known to me, and appertain to my proper nature; 
in a word, than myself. But I see clearly what is the state of the case. My mind 
is apt to wander, and will not yet submit to be restrained within the limits o 
truth. Let us therefore leave the mind to itself once more, and, according to it 
every kind of liberty [permit it to consider the objects that appear to it from 
without], in order that, having afterward withdrawn it from these gently and 
opportunely [ and fixed it on the consideration of its being and the properties 
it finds in itself], it may then be the more easily controlled.[L][F]</p>
<p></font><a name="11. Let us"><font size="2">11. Let us now accordingly 
consider the objects that are commonly thought to be [the most easily, and 
likewise] the most distinctly known, viz., the bodies we touch and see; not, 
indeed, bodies in general, for these general notions are usually somewhat more 
confused, but one body in particular. Take, for example, this piece of wax; it 
is quite fresh, having been but recently taken from the beehive; it has not yet 
lost the sweetness of the honey it contained; it still retains somewhat of the 
odor of the flowers from which it was gathered; its color, figure, size, are 
apparent ( to the sight); it is hard, cold, easily handled; and sounds when 
struck upon with the finger. In fine, all that contributes to make a body as 
distinctly known as possible, is found in the one before us. But, while I am 
speaking, let it be placed near the fire--what remained of the taste exhales, 
the smell evaporates, the color changes, its figure is destroyed, its size 
increases, it becomes liquid, it grows hot, it can hardly be handled, and, 
although struck upon, it emits no sound. Does the same wax still remain after 
this change? It must be admitted that it does remain; no one doubts it, or 
judges otherwise. What, then, was it I knew with so much distinctness in the 
piece of wax? Assuredly, it could be nothing of all that I observed by means of 
the senses, since all the things that fell under taste, smell, sight, touch, and 
hearing are changed, and yet the same wax remains. [L][F]</p>
<p>12. It was perhaps what I now think, viz., that this wax was neither the 
sweetness of honey, the pleasant odor of flowers, the whiteness, the figure, nor 
the sound, but only a body that a little before appeared to me conspicuous under 
these forms, and which is now perceived under others. But, to speak precisely, 
what is it that I imagine when I think of it in this way? Let it be attentively 
considered, and, retrenching all that does not belong to the wax, let us see 
what remains. There certainly remains nothing, except something extended, 
flexible, and movable. But what is meant by flexible and movable ? Is it not 
that I imagine that the piece of wax, being round, is capable of becoming 
square, or of passing from a square into a triangular figure ? Assuredly such is 
not the case, because I conceive that it admits of an infinity of similar 
changes; and I am, moreover, unable to compass this infinity by imagination, and 
consequently this conception which I have of the wax is not the product of the 
faculty of imagination. But what now is this extension ? Is it not also unknown 
? for it becomes greater when the wax is melted, greater when it is boiled, and 
greater still when the heat increases; and I should not conceive [clearly and] 
according to truth, the wax as it is, if I did not suppose that the piece we are 
considering admitted even of a wider variety of extension than I ever imagined, 
I must, therefore, admit that I cannot even comprehend by imagination what the 
piece of wax is, and that it is the mind alone ( mens, Lat., entendement,, F.) 
which perceives it. I speak of one piece in particular; for as to wax in 
general, this is still more evident. But what is the piece of wax that can be 
perceived only by the [understanding or] mind? It is certainly the same which I 
see, touch, imagine; and, in fine, it is the same which, from the beginning, I 
believed it to be. But (and this it is of moment to observe) the perception of 
it is neither an act of sight, of touch, nor of imagination, and never was 
either of these, though it might formerly seem so, but is simply an intuition (inspectio) 
of the mind, which may be imperfect and confused, as it formerly was, or very 
clear and distinct, as it is at present, according as the attention is more or 
less directed to the elements which it contains, and of which it is 
composed.[L][F]</p>
<p>13. But, meanwhile, I feel greatly astonished when I observe [the weakness of 
my mind, and] its proneness to error. For although, without at all giving 
expression to what I think, I consider all this in my own mind, words yet 
occasionally impede my progress, and I am almost led into error by the terms of 
ordinary language. We say, for example, that we see the same wax when it is 
before us, and not that we judge it to be the same from its retaining the same 
color and figure: whence I should forthwith be disposed to conclude that the wax 
is known by the act of sight, and not by the intuition of the mind alone, were 
it not for the analogous instance of human beings passing on in the street 
below, as observed from a window. In this case I do not fail to say that I see 
the men themselves, just as I say that I see the wax; and yet what do I see from 
the window beyond hats and cloaks that might cover artificial machines, whose 
motions might be determined by springs ? But I judge that there are human beings 
from these appearances, and thus I comprehend, by the faculty of judgment alone 
which is in the mind, what I believed I saw with my eyes.[L][F]</p>
<p>14. The man who makes it his aim to rise to knowledge superior to the common, 
ought to be ashamed to seek occasions of doubting from the vulgar forms of 
speech: instead, therefore, of doing this, I shall proceed with the matter in 
hand, and inquire whether I had a clearer and more perfect perception of the 
piece of wax when I first saw it, and when I thought I knew it by means of the 
external sense itself, or, at all events, by the common sense (sensus communis), 
as it is called, that is, by the imaginative faculty; or whether I rather 
apprehend it more clearly at present, after having examined with greater care, 
both what it is, and in what way it can be known. It would certainly be 
ridiculous to entertain any doubt on this point. For what, in that first 
perception, g was there distinct ? What did I perceive which any animal might 
not have perceived ? But when I distinguish the Oval from its exterior forms, 
and when, as if I had stripped it of its vestments, I consider it quite naked, 
it is certain, although some error may still be found in my judgment, that I 
cannot, nevertheless, thus apprehend it without possessing a human mind.[L][F]</p>
<p>15. But finally, what shall I say of the mind itself, that is, of myself ? 
for as yet I do not admit that I am anything but mind. What, then! I who seem to 
possess so distinct an apprehension of the piece of wax, do I not know myself, 
both with greater truth and certitude, and also much more distinctly and 
clearly? For if I judge that the wax exists because I see it, it assuredly 
follows, much more evidently, that I myself am or exist, for the same reason: 
for it is possible that what I see may not in truth be wax, and that I do not 
even possess eyes with which to see anything; but it cannot be that when I see, 
or, which comes to the same thing, when I think I see, I myself who think am 
nothing. So likewise, if I judge that the wax exists because I touch it, it will 
still also follow that I am; and if I determine that my imagination, or any 
other cause, whatever it be, persuades me of the existence of the wax, I will 
still draw the same conclusion. And what is here remarked of the piece of wax, 
is applicable to all the other things that are external to me. And further, if 
the [notion or] perception of wax appeared to me more precise and distinct, 
after that not only sight and touch, but many other causes besides, rendered it 
manifest to my apprehension, with how much greater distinctness must I now know 
myself, since all the reasons that contribute to the knowledge of the nature of 
wax, or of any body whatever, manifest still better the nature of my mind ? And 
there are besides so many other things in the mind itself that contribute to the 
illustration of its nature, that those dependent on the body, to which I have 
here referred, scarcely merit to be taken into account.[L][F]</p>
<p>16. But, in conclusion, I find I have insensibly reverted to the point I 
desired; for, since it is now manifest to me that bodies themselves are not 
properly perceived by the senses nor by the faculty of imagination, but by the 
intellect alone; and since they are not perceived because they are seen and 
touched, but only because they are understood [ or rightly comprehended by 
thought ], I readily discover that there is nothing more easily or clearly 
apprehended than my own mind. But because it is difficult to rid one's self so 
promptly of an opinion to which one has been long accustomed, it will be 
desirable to tarry for some time at this stage, that, by long continued 
meditation, I may more deeply impress upon my memory this new knowledge.[L][F]</p>

<p>7. But now if because I can draw from my thought the idea of an object, it 
follows that all I clearly and distinctly apprehend to pertain to this object, 
does in truth belong to it, may I not from this derive an argument for the 
existence of God? It is certain that I no less find the idea of a God in my 
consciousness, that is the idea of a being supremely perfect, than that of any 
figure or number whatever: and I know with not less clearness and distinctness 
that an [actual and] eternal existence pertains to his nature than that all 
which is demonstrable of any figure or number really belongs to the nature of 
that figure or number; and, therefore, although all the conclusions of the 
preceding Meditations were false, the existence of God would pass with me for a 
truth at least as certain as I ever judged any truth of mathematics to be.[L] 
[F]</p>
<p>8. Indeed such a doctrine may at first sight appear to contain more sophistry 
than truth. For, as I have been accustomed in every other matter to distinguish 
between existence and essence, I easily believe that the existence can be 
separated from the essence of God, and that thus God may be conceived as not 
actually existing. But, nevertheless, when I think of it more attentively, it 
appears that the existence can no more be separated from the essence of God, 
than the idea of a mountain from that of a valley, or the equality of its three 
angles to two right angles, from the essence of a [rectilinear] triangle; so 
that it is not less impossible to conceive a God, that is, a being supremely 
perfect, to whom existence is awanting, or who is devoid of a certain 
perfection, than to conceive a mountain without a valley.[L] [F]</p>
<a name="9">
<p>9. But though, in truth, I cannot conceive a God unless as existing, any more 
than I can a mountain without a valley, yet, just as it does not follow that 
there is any mountain in the world merely because I conceive a mountain with a 
valley, so likewise, though I conceive God as existing, it does not seem to 
follow on that account that God exists; for my thought imposes no necessity on 
things; and as I may imagine a winged horse, though there be none such, so I 
could perhaps attribute existence to God, though no God existed.[L] [F]</p>
</a><a name="10">
<p>10. But the cases are not analogous, and a fallacy lurks under the semblance 
of this objection: for because I cannot conceive a mountain without a valley, it 
does not follow that there is any mountain or valley in existence, but simply 
that the mountain or valley, whether they do or do not exist, are inseparable 
from each other; whereas, on the other hand, because I cannot conceive God 
unless as existing, it follows that existence is inseparable from him, and 
therefore that he really exists: not that this is brought about by my thought, 
or that it imposes any necessity on things, but, on the contrary, the necessity 
which lies in the thing itself, that is, the necessity of the existence of God, 
determines me to think in this way: for it is not in my power to conceive a God 
without existence, that is, a being supremely perfect, and yet devoid of an 
absolute perfection, as I am free to imagine a horse with or without wings.[L] 
[F]</p>
<p>11. Nor must it be alleged here as an objection, that it is in truth 
necessary to admit that God exists, after having supposed him to possess all 
perfections, since existence is one of them, but that my original supposition 
was not necessary; just as it is not necessary to think that all quadrilateral 
figures can be inscribed in the circle, since, if I supposed this, I should be 
constrained to admit that the rhombus, being a figure of four sides, can be 
therein inscribed, which, however, is manifestly false. This objection is, I 
say, incompetent; for although it may not be necessary that I shall at any time 
entertain the notion of Deity, yet each time I happen to think of a first and 
sovereign being, and to draw, so to speak, the idea of him from the storehouse 
of the mind, I am necessitated to attribute to him all kinds of perfections, 
though I may not then enumerate them all, nor think of each of them in 
particular. And this necessity is sufficient, as soon as I discover that 
existence is a perfection, to cause me to infer the existence of this first and 
sovereign being; just as it is not necessary that I should ever imagine any 
triangle, but whenever I am desirous of considering a rectilinear figure 
composed of only three angles, it is absolutely necessary to attribute those 
properties to it from which it is correctly inferred that its three angles are 
not greater than two right angles, although perhaps I may not then advert to 
this relation in particular. But when I consider what figures are capable of 
being inscribed in the circle, it is by no means necessary to hold that all 
quadrilateral figures are of this number; on the contrary, I cannot even imagine 
such to be the case, so long as I shall be unwilling to accept in thought aught 
that I do not clearly and distinctly conceive; and consequently there is a vast 
difference between false suppositions, as is the one in question, and the true 
ideas that were born with me, the first and chief of which is the idea of God. 
For indeed I discern on many grounds that this idea is not factitious depending 
simply on my thought, but that it is the representation of a true and immutable 
nature: in the first place because I can conceive no other being, except God, to 
whose essence existence [necessarily] pertains; in the second, because it is 
impossible to conceive two or more gods of this kind; and it being supposed that 
one such God exists, I clearly see that he must have existed from all eternity, 
and will exist to all eternity; and finally, because I apprehend many other 
properties in God, none of which I can either diminish or change.[L] [F]</p>
<p>12. But, indeed, whatever mode of probation I in the end adopt, it always 
returns to this, that it is only the things I clearly and distinctly conceive 
which have the power of completely persuading me. And although, of the objects I 
conceive in this manner, some, indeed, are obvious to every one, while others 
are only discovered after close and careful investigation; nevertheless after 
they are once discovered, the latter are not esteemed less certain than the 
former. Thus, for example, to take the case of a right-angled triangle, although 
it is not so manifest at first that the square of the base is equal to the 
squares of the other two sides, as that the base is opposite to the greatest 
angle; nevertheless, after it is once apprehended. we are as firmly persuaded of 
the truth of the former as of the latter. And, with respect to God if I were not 
pre-occupied by prejudices, and my thought beset on all sides by the continual 
presence of the images of sensible objects, I should know nothing sooner or more 
easily then the fact of his being. For is there any truth more clear than the 
existence of a Supreme Being, or of God, seeing it is to his essence alone that 
[necessary and eternal] existence pertains? [L] [F]</p>
<p>13. And although the right conception of this truth has cost me much close 
thinking, nevertheless at present I feel not only as assured of it as of what I 
deem most certain, but I remark further that the certitude of all other truths 
is so absolutely dependent on it that without this knowledge it is impossible 
ever to know anything perfectly. [L] [F]</p>
<p>14. For although I am of such a nature as to be unable, while I possess a 
very clear and distinct apprehension of a matter, to resist the conviction of 
its truth, yet because my constitution is also such as to incapacitate me from 
keeping my mind continually fixed on the same object and as I frequently 
recollect a past judgment without at the same time being able to recall the 
grounds of it, it may happen meanwhile that other reasons are presented to me 
which would readily cause me to change my opinion, if I did not know that God 
existed; and thus I should possess no true and certain knowledge, but merely 
vague and vacillating opinions. Thus, for example, when r consider the nature of 
the [rectilinear] triangle, it most clearly appears to me, who have been 
instructed in the principles of geometry, that its three angles are equal to two 
right angles, and I find it impossible to believe otherwise, while I apply my 
mind to the demonstration; but as soon as I cease from attending to the process 
of proof, although I still remember that I had a clear comprehension of it, yet 
I may readily come to doubt of the truth demonstrated, if I do not know that 
there is a God: for I may persuade myself that I have been so constituted by 
nature as to be sometimes deceived, even in matters which I think I apprehend 
with the greatest evidence and certitude, especially when I recollect that I 
frequently considered many things to be true and certain which other reasons 
afterward constrained me to reckon as wholly false.[L] [F]</p>
<p>15. But after I have discovered that God exists, seeing I also at the same 
time observed that all things depend on him, and that he is no deceiver, and 
thence inferred that all which I clearly and distinctly perceive is of necessity 
true: although I no longer attend to the grounds of a judgment, no opposite 
reason can be alleged sufficient to lead me to doubt of its truth, provided only 
I remember that 1 once possessed a clear and distinct comprehension of it. My 
knowledge of it thus becomes true and certain. And this same knowledge extends 
likewise to whatever I remember to have formerly demonstrated, as the truths of 
geometry and the like: for what can be alleged against them to lead me to doubt 
of them ? Will it be that my nature is such that I may be frequently deceived? 
But I already know that I cannot be deceived in judgments of the grounds of 
which I possess a clear knowledge. Will it be that I formerly deemed things to 
be true and certain which I afterward discovered to be false ? But I had no 
clear and distinct knowledge of any of those things, and, being as yet ignorant 
of the rule by which I am assured of the truth of a judgment, I was led to give 
my assent to them on grounds which I afterward discovered were less strong than 
at the time I imagined them to be. What further objection, then, is there ? Will 
it be said that perhaps I am dreaming (an objection I lately myself raised), or 
that all the thoughts of which I am now conscious have no more truth than the 
reveries of my dreams ? But although, in truth, I should be dreaming, the rule 
still holds that all which is clearly presented to my intellect is indisputably 
true.[L] [F]</p>
<p>16. And thus I very clearly see that the certitude and truth of all 
sciencedepends on the knowledge alone of the true God, insomuch that, before I 
knew him, I could have no perfect knowledge of any other thing. And now that I 
know him, I possess the means of acquiring a perfect knowledge respecting 
innumerable matters, as well relative to God himself and other intellectual 
objects as to corporeal nature, in so far as it is the object of pure 
mathematics [which do not consider whether it exists or not].[L] [F]</p>
