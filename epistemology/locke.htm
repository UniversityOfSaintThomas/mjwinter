					1. <i>Knowledge of the existence of other finite beings is 
					to be had only by actual sensation.</i> The knowledge of our 
					own being we have by intuition. The existence of a God, 
					reason clearly makes known to us, as has been shown.<p>The 
					knowledge of the existence of any other thing we can have 
					only by sensation&nbsp;: for there being no necessary connexion 
					of real existence with any idea a man hath in his memory&nbsp;; 
					nor of any other existence but that of God with the 
					existence of any particular man&nbsp;: no particular man can know 
					the existence of any other being, but only when, by actual 
					operating upon him, it makes itself perceived by him. For, 
					the having the idea of anything in our mind, no more proves 
					the existence of that thing, than the picture of a man 
					evidences his being in the world, or the visions of a dream 
					make thereby a true history.</p>
					<p>2. <i>Instance&nbsp;: whiteness of this paper.</i> It is 
					therefore the actual receiving of ideas from without that 
					gives us notice of the existence of other things, and makes 
					us know, that something doth exist at that time without us, 
					which causes that idea in us&nbsp;; though perhaps we neither 
					know nor consider how it does it. For it takes not from the 
					certainty of our senses, and the ideas we receive by them, 
					that we know not the manner wherein they are produced&nbsp;: v.g. 
					whilst I write this, I have, by the paper affecting my eyes, 
					that idea produced in my mind, which, whatever object 
					causes, I call white&nbsp;; by which I know that that quality or 
					accident (i.e. whose appearance before my eyes always causes 
					that idea) doth really exist, and hath a being without me. 
					And of this, the greatest assurance I can possibly have, and 
					to which my faculties can attain, is the testimony of my 
					eyes, which are the proper and sole judges of this thing&nbsp;; 
					whose testimony I have reason to rely on as so certain, that 
					I can no more doubt, whilst I write this, that I see white 
					and black, and that something really exists that causes that 
					sensation in me, than that I write or move my hand&nbsp;; which 
					is a certainty as great as human nature is capable of, 
					concerning the existence of anything, but a man’s self 
					alone, and of God.</p>
					<p>3. <i>This notice by our senses, though not so certain as 
					demonstration, yet may be called knowledge, and proves the 
					existence of things without us.</i> The notice we have by 
					our senses of the existing of things without us, though it 
					be not altogether so certain as our intuitive knowledge, or 
					the deductions of our reason employed about the clear 
					abstract ideas of our own minds&nbsp;; yet it is an assurance 
					that deserves the name of knowledge. If we persuade 
					ourselves that our faculties act and inform us right 
					concerning the existence of those objects that affect them, 
					it cannot pass for an ill-grounded confidence&nbsp;: for I think 
					nobody can, in earnest, be so sceptical as to be uncertain 
					of the existence of those things which he sees and feels. At 
					least, he that can doubt so far, (whatever he may have with 
					his own thoughts,) will never have any controversy with me&nbsp;; 
					since he can never be sure I say anything contrary to his 
					own opinion. As to myself, I think God has given me 
					assurance enough of the existence of things without me&nbsp;: 
					since, by their different application, I can produce in 
					myself both pleasure and pain, which is one great 
					concernment of my present state. This is certain&nbsp;: the 
					confidence that our faculties do not herein deceive us, is 
					the greatest assurance we are capable of concerning the 
					existence of material beings. For we cannot act anything but 
					by our faculties&nbsp;; nor talk of knowledge itself, but by the 
					help of those faculties which are fitted to apprehend even 
					what knowledge is.</p>
					<p>But besides the assurance we have from our senses 
					themselves, that they do not err in the information they 
					give us of the existence of things without us, when they are 
					affected by them, we are further confirmed in this assurance 
					by other concurrent reasons&nbsp;: –</p>
					<p>4. <i>Confirmed by concurrent reasons&nbsp;: – First, because 
					we cannot have ideas of sensation but by the inlet of the 
					senses.</i> It is plain those perceptions are produced in us 
					by exterior causes affecting our senses&nbsp;: because those that 
					want the organs of any sense, never can have the ideas 
					belonging to that sense produced in their minds. This is too 
					evident to be doubted&nbsp;: and therefore we cannot but be 
					assured that they come in by the organs of that sense, and 
					no other way. The organs themselves, it is plain, do not 
					produce them&nbsp;: for then the eyes of a man in the dark would 
					produce colours, and his nose smell roses in the winter&nbsp;: 
					but we see nobody gets the relish of a pineapple, till he 
					goes to the Indies, where it is, and tastes it.</p>
					<p>5. <i>Secondly, Because we find that an idea from actual 
					sensation, and another from memory, are very distinct 
					perceptions.</i> Because sometimes I find that I cannot 
					avoid the having those ideas produced in my mind. For 
					though, when my eyes are shut, or windows fast, I can at 
					pleasure recall to my mind the ideas of light, or the sun, 
					which former sensations had lodged in my memory&nbsp;; so I can 
					at pleasure lay by that idea, and take into my view that of 
					the smell of a rose, or taste of sugar. But, if I turn my 
					eyes at noon towards the sun, I cannot avoid the ideas which 
					the light or sun then produces in me. So that there is a 
					manifest difference between the ideas laid up in my memory, 
					(over which, if they were there only, I should have 
					constantly the same power to dispose of them, and lay them 
					by at pleasure,) and those which force themselves upon me, 
					and I cannot avoid having. And therefore it must needs be 
					some exterior cause, and the brisk acting of some objects 
					without me, whose efficacy I cannot resist, that produces 
					those ideas in my mind, whether I will or no. Besides, there 
					is nobody who doth not perceive the difference in himself 
					between contemplating the sun, as he hath the idea of it in 
					his memory, and actually looking upon it&nbsp;: of which two, his 
					perception is so distinct, that few of his ideas are more 
					distinguishable one from another. And therefore he hath 
					certain knowledge that they are not both memory, or the 
					actions of his mind, and fancies only within him&nbsp;; but that 
					actual seeing hath a cause without.</p>
					<p>6. <i>Thirdly, because pleasure or pain, which 
					accompanies actual sensation, accompanies not the returning 
					of those ideas without the external objects.</i> Add to 
					this, that many of those ideas are produced in us with pain, 
					which afterwards we remember without the least offence. 
					Thus, the pain of heat or cold, when the idea of it is 
					revived in our minds, gives us no disturbance&nbsp;; which, when 
					felt, was very troublesome&nbsp;; and is again, when actually 
					repeated&nbsp;: which is occasioned by the disorder the external 
					object causes in our bodies when applied to them&nbsp;: and we 
					remember the pains of hunger, thirst, or the headache, 
					without any pain at all&nbsp;; which would either never disturb 
					us, or else constantly do it, as often as we thought of it, 
					were there nothing more but ideas floating in our minds, and 
					appearances entertaining our fancies, without the real 
					existence of things affecting us from abroad. The same may 
					be said of pleasure, accompanying several actual sensations. 
					And though mathematical demonstration depends not upon 
					sense, yet the examining them by diagrams gives great credit 
					to the evidence of our sight, and seems to give it a 
					certainty approaching to that of demonstration itself. For, 
					it would be very strange, that a man should allow it for an 
					undeniable truth, that two angles of a figure, which he 
					measures by lines and angles of a diagram, should be bigger 
					one than the other, and yet doubt of the existence of those 
					lines and angles, which by looking on he makes use of to 
					measure that by.</p>
					<p>7. <i>Fourthly, because our senses assist one another’s 
					testimony of the existence of outward things, and enable us 
					to predict.</i> Our senses in many cases bear witness to the 
					truth of each other’s report, concerning the existence of 
					sensible things without us. He that sees a fire, may, if he 
					doubt whether it be anything more than a bare fancy, feel it 
					too&nbsp;; and be convinced, by putting his hand in it. Which 
					certainly could never be put into such exquisite pain by a 
					bare idea or phantom, unless that the pain be a fancy too&nbsp;: 
					which yet he cannot, when the burn is well, by raising the 
					idea of it, bring upon himself again.</p>
					<p>Thus I see, whilst I write this, I can change the 
					appearance of the paper&nbsp;; and by designing the letters, tell 
					beforehand what new idea it shall exhibit the very next 
					moment, by barely drawing my pen over it&nbsp;: which will 
					neither appear (let me fancy as much as I will) if my hands 
					stand still&nbsp;; or though I move my pen, if my eyes be shut&nbsp;: 
					nor, when those characters are once made on the paper, can I 
					choose afterwards but see them as they are&nbsp;; that is, have 
					the ideas of such letters as I have made. Whence it is 
					manifest, that they are not barely the sport and play of my 
					own imagination, when I find that the characters that were 
					made at the pleasure of my own thoughts, do not obey them&nbsp;; 
					nor yet cease to be, whenever I shall fancy it, but continue 
					to affect my senses constantly and regularly, according to 
					the figures I made them. To which if we will add, that the 
					sight of those shall, from another man, draw such sounds as 
					I beforehand design they shall stand for, there will be 
					little reason left to doubt that those words I write do 
					really exist without me, when they cause a long series of 
					regular sounds to affect my ears, which could not be the 
					effect of my imagination, nor could my memory retain them in 
					that order.</p>
					<p>..........</p>
					<p>9. <i>But reaches no further than actual sensation.</i> 
					In fine, then, when our senses do actually convey into our 
					understandings any idea, we cannot but be satisfied that 
					there doth something at that time really exist without us, 
					which doth affect our senses, and by them give notice of 
					itself to our apprehensive faculties, and actually produce 
					that idea which we then perceive&nbsp;: and we cannot so far 
					distrust their testimony, as to doubt that such collections 
					of simple ideas as we have observed by our senses to be 
					united together, do really exist together. But this 
					knowledge extends as far as the present testimony of our 
					senses, employed about particular objects that do then 
					affect them, and no further. For if I saw such a collection 
					of simple ideas as is wont to be called man, existing 
					together one minute since, and am now alone, I cannot be 
					certain that the same man exists now, since there is no 
					necessary connexion of his existence a minute since with his 
					existence now&nbsp;: by a thousand ways he may cease to be, since 
					I had the testimony of my senses for his existence. And if I 
					cannot be certain that the man I saw last to-day is now in 
					being, I can less be certain that he is so who hath been 
					longer removed from my senses, and I have not seen since 
					yesterday, or since the last year&nbsp;: and much less can I be 
					certain of the existence of men that I never saw. And, 
					therefore, though it be highly probable that millions of men 
					do now exist, yet, whilst I am alone, writing this, I have 
					not that certainty of it which we strictly call knowledge&nbsp;; 
					though the great likelihood of it puts me past doubt, and it 
					be reasonable for me to do several things upon the 
					confidence that there are men (and men also of my 
					acquaintance, with whom I have to do) now in the world&nbsp;: but 
					this is but probability, not knowledge.</p>
					<p>10. <i>Folly to expect demonstration in everything.</i> 
					Whereby yet we may observe how foolish and vain a thing it 
					is for a man of a narrow knowledge, who having reason given 
					him to judge of the different evidence and probability of 
					things, and to be swayed accordingly&nbsp;; how vain, I say, it 
					is to expect demonstration and certainty in things not 
					capable of it&nbsp;; and refuse assent to very rational 
					propositions, and act contrary to very plain and clear 
					truths, because they cannot be made out so evident, as to 
					surmount every the least (I will not say reason, but) 
					pretence of doubting. He that, in the ordinary affairs of 
					life, would admit of nothing but direct plain demonstration, 
					would be sure of nothing in this world, but of perishing 
					quickly. The wholesomeness of his meat or drink would not 
					give him reason to venture on it&nbsp;: and I would fain know 
					what it is he could do upon such grounds as are capable of 
					no doubt, no objection.</div>
