<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>8. But now that I begin to know myself better, and to
discover more clearly the author of my being, I do not, indeed, think that I
ought rashly to admit all which the senses seem to teach, nor, on the other hand,
is it my conviction that I ought to doubt in general of their teachings. [L]
[F]</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>9. And, firstly, because I know that all which I
clearly and distinctly conceive can be produced by God exactly as I conceive
it, it is sufficient that I am able clearly and distinctly to conceive one
thing apart from another, in order to be certain that the one is different from
the other, seeing they may at least be made to exist separately, by the
omnipotence of God; and it matters not by what power this separation is made,
in order to be compelled to judge them different; and, therefore, merely
because I know with certitude that I exist, and because, in the meantime, I do
not observe that aught necessarily belongs to my nature or essence beyond my
being a thinking thing, I rightly conclude that my essence consists only in my
being a thinking thing [or a substance whose whole essence or nature is merely
thinking]. And although I may, or rather, as I will shortly say, although I
certainly do possess a body with which I am very closely conjoined;
nevertheless, because, on the one hand, I have a clear and distinct idea of
myself, in as far as I am only a thinking and unextended thing, and as, on the
other hand, I possess a distinct idea of body, in as far as it is only an extended
and unthinking thing, it is certain that I, [that is, my mind, by which I am
what I am], is entirely and truly distinct from my body, and may exist without
it. [L] [F]</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><a
name=3><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>10. Moreover, I find in myself diverse
faculties of thinking that have each their special mode: for example, I find I
possess the faculties of imagining and perceiving, without which I can indeed
clearly and distinctly conceive myself as entire, but I cannot reciprocally
conceive them without conceiving myself, that is to say, without an intelligent
substance in which they reside, for [in the notion we have of them, or to use
the terms of the schools] in their formal concept, they comprise some sort of
intellection; whence I perceive that they are distinct from myself as modes are
from things. I remark likewise certain other faculties, as the power of
changing place, of assuming diverse figures, and the like, that cannot be
conceived and cannot therefore exist, any more than the preceding, apart from a
substance in which they inhere. It is very evident, however, that these
faculties, if they really exist, must belong to some corporeal or extended </span></a><span
class=GramE><span style='mso-bookmark:3'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>substance</span></span></span><span
style='mso-bookmark:3'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, since in their clear
and distinct concept there is contained some sort of extension, but no
intellection at all. Further, I cannot doubt but that there is in me a certain
passive faculty of perception, that is, of receiving and taking knowledge of
the ideas of sensible things; but this would be useless to me, if there did not
also exist in me, or in some other thing, another active faculty capable of
forming and producing those ideas. </span></span><a name="But_this"></a><span
style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>But this active
faculty cannot be in me [in as far as I am but a thinking thing], seeing that
it does not presuppose thought, and also that those ideas are frequently
produced in my mind without my contributing to it in any way, and even
frequently contrary to my will. This faculty must therefore exist in some
substance different from me, in which all the objective reality of the ideas
that are produced by this faculty is contained formally or eminently, as I
before remarked; and this substance is either a body, that is to say, a
corporeal nature in which is contained formally [and in effect] all that is
objectively [and by representation] in those ideas; or it is God himself, or
some other creature, of a rank superior to body, in which the same is contained
eminently. But as God is no deceiver, it is manifest that he does not of
himself and immediately communicate those ideas to me, nor even by the
intervention of any creature in which their objective reality is not formally,
but only eminently, contained. For as he has given me no faculty whereby I can
discover this to be the case, but, on the contrary, a very strong inclination
to believe that those ideas arise from corporeal objects, I do not see how he could
be vindicated from the charge of deceit, if in truth they proceeded from any
other source, or were produced by other causes than corporeal things: and
accordingly it must be concluded, that corporeal objects exist. Nevertheless,
they are not perhaps exactly such as we perceive by the senses, for their
comprehension by the senses is, in many instances, very obscure and confused;
but it is at least necessary to admit that all which I clearly and distinctly
conceive as in them, that is, generally speaking all that is comprehended in
the object of speculative geometry, really exists external to me. [L] [F]</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>11. But with
respect to other things which are either only particular, as, for example, that
the sun is of such a size and figure, etc., or are conceived with less
clearness and distinctness, as light, sound, pain, and the like, although they
are highly dubious and uncertain, nevertheless on the ground alone that God is
no deceiver, and that consequently he has permitted no falsity in my opinions
which he has not likewise given me a faculty of correcting, I think I may with
safety conclude that I possess in myself the means of arriving at the truth.
And, in the first place, it cannot be doubted that in each of the dictates of
nature there is some truth: for by nature, considered in general, I now
understand nothing more than God himself, or the order and disposition
established by God in created things; and by my nature in particular I
understand the assemblage of all that God has given me. [L] [F]</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>12. But there is
nothing which that nature teaches me more expressly <span class=GramE>[ or</span>
more sensibly ] than that I have a body which is ill affected when I feel pain,
and stands in need of food and drink when I experience the sensations of hunger
and thirst, etc. And therefore I ought not to doubt but that there is some
truth in these informations. [L] [F]</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>13. Nature
likewise teaches me by these sensations of pain, hunger, thirst, etc., that I
am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a vessel, but that I am besides so
intimately conjoined, and as it were intermixed with it, that my mind and body
compose a certain unity. For if this were not the case, I should not feel pain
when my body is hurt, seeing I am merely a thinking thing, but should perceive
the wound by the understanding alone, just as a pilot perceives by sight when
any part of his vessel is damaged; and when my body has need of food or drink,
I should have a clear knowledge of this, and not be made aware of it by the
confused sensations of hunger and thirst: for, in truth, all these sensations
of hunger, thirst, pain, etc., are nothing more than certain confused modes of
thinking, arising from the union and apparent fusion of mind and body. [L] [F]</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>14. Besides this,
nature teaches me that my own body is surrounded by many other bodies, some of
which I have to seek after, and others to shun. And indeed, as I perceive
different sorts of colors, sounds, odors, tastes, heat, hardness, etc., I
safely conclude that there are in the bodies from which the diverse perceptions
of the senses proceed, certain varieties corresponding to them, although,
perhaps, not in reality like them; and since, among these diverse perceptions
of the senses, some are agreeable, and others disagreeable, there can be no
doubt that my body, or rather my entire self, in as far as I am composed of
body and mind, may be variously affected, both beneficially and hurtfully, by
surrounding bodies. [L] [F]</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>15. But there are
many other beliefs which though seemingly the teaching of nature, are not in
reality so, but which obtained a place in my mind through a habit of judging
inconsiderately of things. It may thus easily happen that such judgments shall
contain error: thus, for example, the opinion I have that all space in which
there is nothing to affect [or make an impression on] my senses is void: that
in a hot body there is something in every respect similar to the idea of heat
in my mind; that in a white or green body there is the same whiteness or
greenness which I perceive; that in a bitter or sweet body there is the same
taste, and so in other instances; that the stars, towers, and all distant
bodies, are of the same size and figure as they appear to our eyes, etc. But
that I may avoid everything like indistinctness of conception, I must
accurately define what I properly understand by being taught by nature. For
nature is here taken in a narrower sense than when it signifies the sum of all
the things which God has given me; seeing that in that meaning the notion
comprehends much that belongs only to the mind [to which I am not here to be
understood as referring when I use the term nature]; as, for example, the
notion I have of the truth, that what is done cannot be undone, and all the
other truths I discern by the natural light <span class=GramE>[ without</span>
the aid of the body]; and seeing that it comprehends likewise much besides that
belongs only to body, and is not here any more contained under the name nature,
as the quality of heaviness, and the like, of which I do not speak, the term
being reserved exclusively to designate the things which God has given to me as
a being composed of mind and body. But nature, taking the term in the sense
explained, teaches me to shun what causes in me the sensation of pain, and to
pursue what affords me the sensation of pleasure, and other things of this
sort; but I do not discover that it teaches me, in addition to this, from these
diverse perceptions of the senses, to draw any conclusions respecting external
objects without a previous <span class=GramE>[ careful</span> and mature ]
consideration of them by the mind: for it is, as appears to me, the office of
the mind alone, and not of the composite whole of mind and body, to discern the
truth in those matters. Thus, although the impression a star makes on my eye is
not larger than that from the flame of a candle, I do not, nevertheless,
experience any real or positive impulse determining me to believe that the star
is not greater than the flame; the true account of the matter being merely that
I have so judged from my youth without any rational ground. And, though on
approaching the fire I feel heat, and even pain on approaching it too closely,
I have, however, from this no ground for holding that something resembling the
heat I feel is in the fire, any more than that there is something similar to
the pain; all that I have ground for believing is, that there is something in
it, whatever it may be, which excites in me those sensations of heat or pain.
So also, although there are spaces in which I find nothing to excite and affect
my senses, I must not therefore conclude that those spaces contain in them no
body; for I see that in this, as in many other similar matters, I have been
accustomed to pervert the order of nature, because these perceptions of the
senses, although given me by nature merely to signify to my mind what things
are beneficial and hurtful to the composite whole of which it is a part, and
being sufficiently clear and distinct for that purpose, are nevertheless used
by me as infallible rules by which to determine immediately the essence of the
bodies that exist out of me, of which they can of course afford me only the
most obscure and confused knowledge. [L] [F]</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>16. But I have
already sufficiently considered how it happens that, notwithstanding the
supreme goodness of God, there is falsity in my judgments. A difficulty,
however, here presents itself, respecting the things which I am taught by
nature must be pursued or avoided, and also respecting the internal sensations
in which I seem to have occasionally detected error, [and thus to be directly
deceived by nature]: thus, for example, I may be so deceived by the agreeable
taste of some viand with which poison has been mixed, as to be induced to take
the poison. In this case, however, nature may be excused, for it simply leads
me to desire the viand for its agreeable taste, and not the poison, which is
unknown to it; and thus we can infer nothing from this circumstance beyond that
our nature is not omniscient; at which there is assuredly no ground for
surprise, since, man being of a finite nature, his knowledge must likewise be
of a limited perfection. [L] [F]</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>17. But we also
not unfrequently err in that to which we are directly impelled by nature, as is
the case with invalids who desire drink or food that would be hurtful to them.
It will here, perhaps, be alleged that the reason why such persons are deceived
is that their nature is corrupted; but this leaves the difficulty untouched,
for a sick man is not less really the creature of God than a man who is in full
health; and therefore it IS as repugnant to the goodness of God that the nature
of the former should be deceitful as it is for that of the latter to be so. And
as a clock, composed of wheels and counter weights, observes not the less
accurately all the laws of nature when it is ill made, and points out the hours
incorrectly, than when it satisfies the desire of the maker in every respect;
so likewise if the body of man be considered as a kind of machine, so made up
and composed of bones, nerves, muscles, veins, blood, and skin, that although
there were in it no mind, it would still exhibit the same motions which it at
present manifests involuntarily, and therefore without the aid of the mind,
[and simply by the dispositions of its organs], I easily discern that it would
also be as natural for such a body, supposing it dropsical, for example, to
experience the parchedness of the throat that is usually accompanied in the
mind by the sensation of thirst, and to be disposed by this parchedness to move
its nerves and its other parts in the way required for drinking, and thus
increase its malady and do itself harm, as it is natural for it, when it is not
indisposed to be stimulated to drink for its good by a similar cause; and
although looking to the use for which a clock was destined by its maker, I may
say that it is deflected from its proper nature when it incorrectly indicates
the hours, and on the same principle, considering the machine of the human body
as having been formed by God for the sake of the motions which it usually
manifests, although I may likewise have ground for thinking that it does not
follow the order of its nature when the throat is parched and drink does not
tend to its preservation, nevertheless I yet plainly discern that this latter
acceptation of the term nature is very different from the other: for this is
nothing more than a certain denomination, depending entirely on my thought, and
hence called extrinsic, by which I compare a sick man and an imperfectly
constructed clock with the idea I have of a man in good health and a well made
clock; while by the other acceptation of nature is understood something which
is truly found in things, and therefore possessed of some truth. [L] [F]</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>18. But certainly,
although in respect of a dropsical body, it is only by way of exterior
denomination that we say its nature is corrupted, when, without requiring
drink, the throat is parched; yet, in respect of the composite whole, that is,
of the mind in its union with the body, it is not a pure denomination, but
really an error of nature, for it to feel thirst when drink would be hurtful to
it: and, accordingly, it still remains to be considered why it is that the
goodness of God does not prevent the nature of man thus taken from being
fallacious. [L] [F]</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>19. To commence
this examination accordingly, I here remark, in the first place, that there is
a vast difference between mind and body, in respect that body, from its nature,
is always divisible, and that mind is entirely indivisible. For in truth, when
I consider the mind, that is, when I consider myself in so far only as I am a
thinking thing, I can distinguish in myself no parts, but I very clearly
discern that I am somewhat absolutely one and entire; and although the whole
mind seems to be united to the whole body, yet, when a foot, an arm, or any
other part is cut off, I am conscious that nothing has been taken from my mind;
nor can the faculties of willing, perceiving, conceiving, etc., properly be
called its parts, for it is the same mind that is exercised [all entire] in
willing, in perceiving, and in conceiving, etc. But quite the opposite holds in
corporeal or extended things; for I cannot imagine any one of them [how small
soever it may be], which I cannot easily sunder in thought, and which,
therefore, I do not know to be divisible. This would be sufficient to teach me
that the mind or soul of man is entirely different from the body, if I had not
already been apprised of it on other grounds. [L] [F]</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>20. I remark, in
the next place, that the mind does not immediately receive the impression from
all the parts of the body, but only from the brain, or perhaps even from one
small part of it, viz., that in which the common sense (senses communis) is
said to be, which as often as it is affected in the same way gives rise to the
same perception in the mind, although meanwhile the other parts of the body may
be diversely disposed, as is proved by innumerable experiments, which it is
unnecessary here to enumerate. [L] [F]</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>21. I remark,
besides, that the nature of body is such that none of its parts can be moved by
another part a little removed from the other, which cannot likewise be moved in
the same way by any one of the parts that lie between those two, although the
most remote part does not act at all. As, for example, in the cord A, B. C, D,
[which is in tension], if its last part D, be pulled, the first part A, will
not be moved in a different way than it would be were one of the intermediate
parts B or c to be pulled, and the last part D meanwhile to remain fixed. And
in the same way, when I feel pain in the foot, the science of physics teaches
me that this sensation is experienced by means of the nerves dispersed over the
foot, which, extending like cords from it to the brain, when they are
contracted in the foot, contract at the same time the inmost parts of the brain
in which they have their origin, and excite in these parts a certain motion
appointed by nature to cause in the mind a sensation of pain, as if existing in
the foot; but as these nerves must pass through the tibia, the leg, the loins,
the back, and neck, in order to reach the brain, it may happen that although
their extremities in the foot are not affected, but only certain of their parts
that pass through the loins or neck, the same movements, nevertheless, are
excited in the brain by this motion as would have been caused there by a hurt
received in the foot, and hence the mind will necessarily feel pain in the
foot, just as if it had been hurt; and the same is true of all the other
perceptions of our senses. [L] [F]</span></span></p>

style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>22. I remark,
finally, that as each of the movements that are made in the part of the brain
by which the mind is immediately affected, impresses it with but a single
sensation, the most likely supposition in the circumstances is, that this
movement causes the mind to experience, among all the sensations which it is
capable of impressing upon it; that one which is the best fitted, and generally
the most useful for the preservation of the human body when it is in full
health. But experience shows us that all the perceptions which nature has given
us are of such a kind as I have mentioned; and accordingly, there is nothing
found in them that <span class=GramE>does</span> not manifest the power and
goodness of God. Thus, for example, when the nerves of the foot are violently
or more than usually shaken, the motion passing through the medulla of the
spine to the innermost parts of the brain affords a sign to the mind on which
it experiences a sensation, viz., of pain, as if it were in the foot, by which
the mind is admonished and excited to do its utmost to remove the cause of it
as dangerous and hurtful to the foot. It is true that God could have so
constituted the nature of man as that the same motion in the brain would have
informed the mind of something altogether different: the motion might, for
example, have been the occasion on which the mind became conscious of itself,
in so far as it is in the brain, or in so far as it is in some place
intermediate between the foot and the brain, or, finally, the occasion on which
it perceived some other object quite different, whatever that might be; but
nothing of all this would have so well contributed to the preservation of the
body as that which the mind actually feels. In the same way, when we stand in
need of drink, there arises from this want a certain parchedness in the throat
that moves its nerves, and by means of them the internal parts of the brain;
and this movement affects the mind with the sensation of thirst, because there
is nothing on that occasion which is more useful for us than to be made aware
that we have need of drink for the preservation of our health; and so in other
instances<span class=GramE>.[</span>L][F]</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>23. Whence it is
quite manifest that, notwithstanding the sovereign goodness of God, the nature
of man, in so far as it is composed of mind and body, cannot but be sometimes
fallacious. For, if there is any cause which excites, not in the foot, but in
some one of the parts of the nerves that stretch from the foot to the brain, or
even in the brain itself, the same movement that is ordinarily created when the
foot is ill affected, pain will be felt, as it were, in the foot, and the sense
will thus be naturally deceived; for as the same movement in the brain can but
impress the mind with the same sensation, and as this sensation is much more frequently
excited by a cause which hurts the foot than by one acting in a different
quarter, it is reasonable that it should lead the mind to feel pain in the foot
rather than in any other part of the body. And if it sometimes happens that the
parchedness of the throat does not arise, as is usual, from drink being
necessary for the health of the body, but from quite the opposite cause, as is
the case with the dropsical, yet it is much better that it should be deceitful
in that instance, than if, on the contrary, it were continually fallacious when
the body is well-disposed; and the same holds true in other cases. [L] [F]</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in'><span
style='mso-bookmark:But_this'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>24. And certainly
this consideration is of great service, not only in enabling me to recognize
the errors to which my nature is liable, but likewise in rendering it more easy
to avoid or correct them: for, knowing that all my senses more usually indicate
to me what is true than what is false, in matters relating to the advantage of
the body, and being able almost always to make use of more than a single sense
in examining the same object, and besides this, being able to use my memory in
connecting present with past knowledge, and my understanding which has already
discovered all the causes of my errors, I ought no longer to fear that falsity
may be met with in what is daily presented to me by the senses. And I ought to
reject all the doubts of those bygone days, as hyperbolical and ridiculous,
especially the general uncertainty respecting sleep, which I could not
distinguish from the waking state: for I now find a very marked difference
between the two states, in respect that our memory can never connect our dreams
with each other and with the course of life, in the way it is in the habit of
doing with events that occur when we are awake. And, in truth, if some one,
when I am awake, appeared to me all of a sudden and as suddenly disappeared, as
do the images I see in sleep, so that I could not observe either whence he came
or whither he went, I should not without reason esteem it either a specter or
phantom formed in my brain, rather than a real man. But when I perceive objects
with regard to which I can distinctly determine both the place whence they
come, and that in which they are, and the time at which they appear to me, and
when, without interruption, I can connect the perception I have of them with
the whole of the other parts of my life, I am perfectly sure that what I thus
perceive occurs while I am awake and not during sleep. And I ought not in the
least degree to doubt of the truth of these presentations, if, after having
called together all my senses, my memory, and my understanding for the purpose
of examining them, no deliverance is given by any one of these faculties which
is repugnant to that of any other: for since God is no deceiver, it necessarily
follows that I am not herein deceived. But because the necessities of action
frequently oblige us to come to a determination before we have had leisure for
so careful an examination, it must be confessed that the life of man is
frequently obnoxious to error with respect to individual objects; and we must,
in conclusion, ac. knowledge the weakness of our nature. [L] [F]</span></span></p>
