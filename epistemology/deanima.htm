<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">II. 8</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let us, to begin with, 
make certain distinctions about sound and hearing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound may mean either of two 
things (a) actual, and (b) potential, sound. There are certain things which, as 
we say, 'have no sound', e.g. sponges or wool, others which have, e.g. bronze 
and in general all things which are smooth and solid-the latter are said to have 
a sound because they can make a sound, i.e. can generate actual sound between 
themselves and the organ of hearing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; Actual sound requires for its 
occurrence (i, ii) two such bodies and (iii) a space between them; for it is 
generated by an impact. Hence it is impossible for one body only to generate a 
sound-there must be a body impinging and a body impinged upon; what sounds does 
so by striking against something else, and this is impossible without a movement 
from place to place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; As we have said, not all 
bodies can by impact on one another produce sound; impact on wool makes no 
sound, while the impact on bronze or any body which is smooth and hollow does. 
Bronze gives out a sound when struck because it is smooth; bodies which are 
hollow owing to reflection repeat the original impact over and over again, the 
body originally set in movement being unable to escape from the concavity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, we must remark that 
sound is heard both in air and in water, though less distinctly in the latter. 
Yet neither air nor water is the principal cause of sound. What is required for 
the production of sound is an impact of two solids against one another and 
against the air. The latter condition is satisfied when the air impinged upon 
does not retreat before the blow, i.e. is not dissipated by it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why it must be struck 
with a sudden sharp blow, if it is to sound-the movement of the whip must outrun 
the dispersion of the air, just as one might get in a stroke at a heap or whirl 
of sand as it was traveling rapidly past.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; An echo occurs, when, a mass 
of air having been unified, bounded, and prevented from dissipation by the 
containing walls of a vessel, the air originally struck by the impinging body 
and set in movement by it rebounds from this mass of air like a ball from a 
wall. It is probable that in all generation of sound echo takes place, though it 
is frequently only indistinctly heard. What happens here must be analogous to 
what happens in the case of light; light is always reflected-otherwise it would 
not be diffused and outside what was directly illuminated by the sun there would 
be blank darkness; but this reflected light is not always strong enough, as it 
is when it is reflected from water, bronze, and other smooth bodies, to cast a 
shadow, which is the distinguishing mark by which we recognize light.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; It is rightly said that an 
empty space plays the chief part in the production of hearing, for what people 
mean by 'the vacuum' is the air, which is what causes hearing, when that air is 
set in movement as one continuous mass; but owing to its friability it emits no 
sound, being dissipated by impinging upon any surface which is not smooth. When 
the surface on which it impinges is quite smooth, what is produced by the 
original impact is a united mass, a result due to the smoothness of the surface 
with which the air is in contact at the other end.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; What has the power of 
producing sound is what has the power of setting in movement a single mass of 
air which is continuous from the impinging body up to the organ of hearing. The 
organ of hearing is physically united with air, and because it is in air, the 
air inside is moved concurrently with the air outside. Hence animals do not hear 
with all parts of their bodies, nor do all parts admit of the entrance of air; 
for even the part which can be moved and can sound has not air everywhere in it. 
Air in itself is, owing to its friability, quite soundless; only when its 
dissipation is prevented is its movement sound. The air in the ear is built into 
a chamber just to prevent this dissipating movement, in order that the animal 
may accurately apprehend all varieties of the movements of the air outside. That 
is why we hear also in water, viz. because the water cannot get into the air 
chamber or even, owing to the spirals, into the outer ear. If this does happen, 
hearing ceases, as it also does if the tympanic membrane is damaged, just as 
sight ceases if the membrane covering the pupil is damaged. It is also a test of 
deafness whether the ear does or does not reverberate like a horn; the air 
inside the ear has always a movement of its own, but the sound we hear is always 
the sounding of something else, not of the organ itself. That is why we say that 
we hear with what is empty and echoes, viz. because what we hear with is a 
chamber which contains a bounded mass of air.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is it that 'sounds', 
the striking body or the struck? Is not the answer 'it is both, but each in a 
different way'? Sound is a movement of what can rebound from a smooth surface 
when struck against it. As we have explained' not everything sounds when it 
strikes or is struck, e.g. if one needle is struck against another, neither 
emits any sound. In order, therefore, that sound may be generated, what is 
struck must be smooth, to enable the air to rebound and be shaken off from it in 
one piece.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; The distinctions between 
different sounding bodies show themselves only in actual sound; as without the 
help of light colours remain invisible, so without the help of actual sound the 
distinctions between acute and grave sounds remain inaudible. Acute and grave 
are here metaphors, transferred from their proper sphere, viz. that of touch, 
where they mean respectively (a) what moves the sense much in a short time, (b) 
what moves the sense little in a long time. Not that what is sharp really moves 
fast, and what is grave, slowly, but that the difference in the qualities of the 
one and the other movement is due to their respective speeds. There seems to be 
a sort of parallelism between what is acute or grave to hearing and what is 
sharp or blunt to touch; what is sharp as it were stabs, while what is blunt 
pushes, the one producing its effect in a short, the other in a long time, so 
that the one is quick, the other slow.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the foregoing suffice as 
an analysis of sound. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">II. 12</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; The following results 
applying to any and every sense may now be formulated.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; (A) By a 'sense' is meant 
what has the power of receiving into itself the sensible forms of things without 
the matter. This must be conceived of as taking place in the way in which a 
piece of wax takes on the impress of a signet-ring without the iron or gold; we 
say that what produces the impression is a signet of bronze or gold, but its 
particular metallic constitution makes no difference: in a similar way the sense 
is affected by what is coloured or flavoured or sounding, but it is indifferent 
what in each case the substance is; what alone matters is what quality it has, 
i.e. in what ratio its constituents are combined.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) By 'an organ of sense' is 
meant that in which ultimately such a power is seated.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; The sense and its organ are 
the same in fact, but their essence is not the same. What perceives is, of 
course, a spatial magnitude, but we must not admit that either the having the 
power to perceive or the sense itself is a magnitude; what they are is a certain 
ratio or power in a magnitude. This enables us to explain why objects of sense 
which possess one of two opposite sensible qualities in a degree largely in 
excess of the other opposite destroy the organs of sense; if the movement set up 
by an object is too strong for the organ, the equipoise of contrary qualities in 
the organ, which just is its sensory power, is disturbed; it is precisely as 
concord and tone are destroyed by too violently twanging the strings of a lyre. 
This explains also why plants cannot perceive. in spite of their having a 
portion of soul in them and obviously being affected by tangible objects 
themselves; for undoubtedly their temperature can be lowered or raised. The 
explanation is that they have no mean of contrary qualities, and so no principle 
in them capable of taking on the forms of sensible objects without their matter; 
in the case of plants the affection is an affection by form-and-matter together. 
The problem might be raised: Can what cannot smell be said to be affected by 
smells or what cannot see by colours, and so on? It might be said that a smell 
is just what can be smelt, and if it produces any effect it can only be so as to 
make something smell it, and it might be argued that what cannot smell cannot be 
affected by smells and further that what can smell can be affected by it only in 
so far as it has in it the power to smell (similarly with the proper objects of 
all the other senses). Indeed that this is so is made quite evident as follows. 
Light or darkness, sounds and smells leave bodies quite unaffected; what does 
affect bodies is not these but the bodies which are their vehicles, e.g. what 
splits the trunk of a tree is not the sound of the thunder but the air which 
accompanies thunder. Yes, but, it may be objected, bodies are affected by what 
is tangible and by flavours. If not, by what are things that are without soul 
affected, i.e. altered in quality? Must we not, then, admit that the objects of 
the other senses also may affect them? Is not the true account this, that all 
bodies are capable of being affected by smells and sounds, but that some on 
being acted upon, having no boundaries of their own, disintegrate, as in the 
instance of air, which does become odorous, showing that some effect is produced 
on it by what is odorous? But smelling is more than such an affection by what is 
odorous-what more? Is not the answer that, while the air owing to the momentary 
duration of the action upon it of what is odorous does itself become perceptible 
to the sense of smell, smelling is an observing of the result produced?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">III. 2</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is through sense 
that we are aware that we are seeing or hearing, it must be either by sight that 
we are aware of seeing, or by some sense other than sight. But the sense that 
gives us this new sensation must perceive both sight and its object, viz. 
colour: so that either (1) there will be two senses both percipient of the same 
sensible object, or (2) the sense must be percipient of itself. Further, even if 
the sense which perceives sight were different from sight, we must either fall 
into an infinite regress, or we must somewhere assume a sense which is aware of 
itself. If so, we ought to do this in the first case.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; This presents a difficulty: 
if to perceive by sight is just to see, and what is seen is colour (or the 
coloured), then if we are to see that which sees, that which sees originally 
must be coloured. It is clear therefore that 'to perceive by sight' has more 
than one meaning; for even when we are not seeing, it is by sight that we 
discriminate darkness from light, though not in the same way as we distinguish 
one colour from another. Further, in a sense even that which sees is coloured; 
for in each case the sense-organ is capable of receiving the sensible object 
without its matter. That is why even when the sensible objects are gone the 
sensings and imaginings continue to exist in the sense-organs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; The activity of the sensible 
object and that of the percipient sense is one and the same activity, and yet 
the distinction between their being remains. Take as illustration actual sound 
and actual hearing: a man may have hearing and yet not be hearing, and that 
which has a sound is not always sounding. But when that which can hear is 
actively hearing and which can sound is sounding, then</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">the actual hearing and the 
actual sound are merged in one (these one might call respectively hearkening and 
sounding).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is true that the 
movement, both the acting and the being acted upon, is to be found in that which 
is acted upon, both the sound and the hearing so far as it is actual must be 
found in that which has the faculty of hearing; for it is in the passive factor 
that the actuality of the active or motive factor is realized; that is why that 
which causes movement may be at rest. Now the actuality of that which can sound 
is just sound or sounding, and the actuality of that which can hear is hearing 
or hearkening; 'sound' and 'hearing' are both ambiguous. The same account 
applies to the other senses and their objects. For as 
the-acting-and-being-acted-upon is to be found in the passive, not in the active 
factor, so also the actuality of the sensible object and that of the sensitive 
subject are both realized in the latter. But while in some cases each aspect of 
the total actuality has a distinct name, e.g. sounding and hearkening, in some 
one or other is nameless, e.g. the actuality of sight is called seeing, but the 
actuality of colour has no name: the actuality of the faculty of taste is called 
tasting, but the actuality of flavour has no name. Since the actualities of the 
sensible object and of the sensitive faculty are one actuality in spite of the 
difference between their modes of being, actual hearing and actual sounding 
appear and disappear from existence at one and the same moment, and so actual 
savour and actual tasting, &amp;c., while as potentialities one of them may exist 
without the other. The earlier students of nature were mistaken in their view 
that without sight there was no white or black, without taste no savour. This 
statement of theirs is partly true, partly false: 'sense' and 'the sensible 
object' are ambiguous terms, i.e. may denote either potentialities or 
actualities: the statement is true of the latter, false of the former. This 
ambiguity they wholly failed to notice.</span></p>
