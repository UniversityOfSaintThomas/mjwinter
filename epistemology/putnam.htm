<p><b>An Argument Against the Possibility of Being a Brain in a Vat:</b>
<p><b>Presupposition</b>: A statement is true if and only if the terms
in a statement refer to the realities they designate.&nbsp; A statement
is false or meaningless otherwise.&nbsp;
<p>For example, ‘Grass is green’ is true if and only if grass is green.&nbsp;
<p><b>1) </b><i>Either we are brains in a vat or we are not brains in a
vat.</i>
<br><b>Either -B or B&nbsp;&nbsp; (assumption)</b>
<p><b>2) </b><i>If&nbsp; we are not brains in a vat, then we know that
the sentence ‘We are brains in a vat’ is false.</i>
<br><b>If-B, then F&nbsp; (assumption)</b>
<p><b>3) </b><i>If we are brains in a vat, then we know that the sentence
‘We are brains in a vat’ is false.</i>
<br><b>If B, then F&nbsp; (assumption)</b>
<p><b>4) </b><i>So we know that the sentence ‘We are brains in a vat’ is
false.</i>
<br><b>F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (from 1,2,3)</b>
<p><b>5) </b><i>If we know that the sentence ‘We are brains in a vat’ is
false, then we know that we are not brains in vats.</i>
<br><b>If F, then K&nbsp;&nbsp; (from presupposition)</b>
<p><b>6)</b><i> So we know that we are not brains in vats.</i>
<br><b>K&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (from 4,5)</b>
