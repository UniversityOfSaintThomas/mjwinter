<h3>PART III. OF KNOWLEDGE AND PROBABILITY. </h3>
<h3>SECT. V. <i>Of the Impressions of the Senses and Memory.</i> </h3>
</center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this kind of reasoning, then, from causation, we employ materials, 
which are of a mix'd and heterogeneous nature, and which, however connected, are 
yet essentially different from each other. All our arguments concerning causes 
and effects consist both of an impression of the memory or, senses, and of the 
idea of that existence, which produces the object of the impression, or is 
produc'd by it. Here therefore we have three things to explain, viz. First, The 
original impression. Secondly, The transition to the idea of the connected cause 
or effect. Thirdly, The nature and qualities of that idea. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to those impressions, which arise from the senses, their ultimate 
cause is, in my opinion, perfectly inexplicable by human reason, and 'twill 
always be impossible to decide with certainty, whether they arise immediately 
from the object, or are produc'd by the creative power of the mind, or are 
deriv'd from the author of our being. Nor is such a question any way material to 
our present purpose. We may draw inferences from the coherence of our 
perceptions, whether they be true or false; whether they represent nature 
justly, or be mere illusions of the senses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we search for the characteristic, which distinguishes the memory 
from the imagination, we must immediately perceive, that it cannot lie in the 
simple ideas it presents to us; since both these faculties borrow their simple 
ideas from the impressions, and can never go beyond these original perceptions. 
These faculties are as little distinguished from each other by the arrangement 
of their complex ideas. For tho' it be a peculiar property of the memory to 
preserve the original order and position of its ideas, while the imagination 
transposes and changes them, as it pleases; yet this difference is not 
sufficient to distinguish them in their operation, or make us know the one from 
the other; it being impossible to recal the past impressions, in order to 
compare them with our present ideas, and see whether their arrangement be 
exactly similar. Since therefore the memory, is known, neither by the order of 
its complex ideas, nor the nature of its simple ones; it follows, that the 
difference betwixt it and the imagination lies in its superior force and 
vivacity. A man may indulge his fancy in feigning any past scene of adventures; 
nor wou'd there be any possibility of distinguishing this from a remembrance of 
a like kind, were not the ideas of the imagination fainter and more obscure. </p>

<h3>SECT. VI. <i>Of the Inference from the Impression to the Idea.</i> </h3>
</center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis easy to observe, that in tracing this relation, the inference we 
draw from cause to effect, is not deriv'd merely from a survey of these 
particular objects, and from such a penetration into their essences as may 
discover the dependance of the one upon the other. There is no object., which 
implies the existence of any other if we consider these objects in themselves, 
and never look beyond the ideas which we form of them. Such an inference wou'd 
amount to knowledge, and wou'd imply the absolute contradiction and 
impossibility of conceiving any thing different. But as all distinct ideas are 
separable, 'tis evident there can be no impossibility of that kind. When we pass 
from a present impression to the idea of any object, we might possibly have 
separated the idea from the impression, and have substituted any other idea in 
its room. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis therefore by EXPERIENCE only, that we can infer the existence of one 
object from that of another. The nature of experience is this. We remember to 
have had frequent instances of the existence of one species of objects; and also 
remember, that the individuals of another species of objects have always 
attended them, and have existed in a regular order of contiguity-and succession 
with regard to them. Thus we remember, to have seen that species of object we 
call flame, and to have felt that species of sensation we call heat. We likewise 
call to mind their constant conjunction in all past instances. Without any 
farther ceremony, we call the one cause and the other effect, and infer the 
existence of the one from that of the other.' In all those instances, from which 
we learn the conjunction of particular causes and effects, both the causes and 
effects have been perceiv'd by the senses, and are remembered But in all cases, 
wherein we reason concerning them, there is only one perceiv'd or remembered, 
and the other is supply'd in conformity to our past experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in advancing we have insensibly discovered a new relation betwixt 
cause and effect, when we least expected it, and were entirely employ'd upon 
another subject. This relation is their CONSTANT CONJUNCTION. Contiguity and 
succession are not sufficient to make us pronounce any two objects to be cause 
and effect, unless we perceive, that these two relations are preserv'd in 
several instances. We may now see the advantage of quitting the direct survey of 
this relation, in order to discover the nature of that necessary connexion, 
which makes so essential a part of it. There are hopes, that by this means we 
may at last arrive at our propos'd end; tho' to tell the truth, this 
new-discover'd relation of a constant conjunction seems to advance us but very 
little in our way. For it implies no more than this, that like objects have 
always been plac'd in like relations of contiguity and succession; and it seems 
evident, at least at first sight, that by this means we can never discover any 
new idea, and can only multiply, but not enlarge the objects of our mind. It may 
be thought, that what we learn not from one object, we can never learn from a 
hundred, which are all of the same kind, and are perfectly resembling in every 
circumstance. As our senses shew us in one instance two bodies, or motions, or 
qualities in certain relations of success] and contiguity; so our memory 
presents us only with a multitude of instances, wherein we always find like 
bodies, motions, or qualities in like relations. From the mere repetition of any 
past impression, even to infinity, there never will arise any new original idea, 
such as that of a necessary connexion; and the number of impressions has in this 
case no more effect than if we confin'd ourselves to one only. But tho' this 
reasoning seems just and obvious; yet as it wou'd be folly to despair too soon, 
we shall continue the thread of our discourse; and having found, that after the 
discovery of the constant conjunction of any objects, we always draw an 
inference from one object to another, we shall now examine the nature of that 
inference, and of the transition from the impression to the idea. Perhaps 'twill 
appear in the end, that the necessary connexion depends on the inference, 
instead of the inference's depending on the necessary connexion. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it appears, that the transition from an impression present to the 
memory or senses to the idea of an object, which we call cause or effect, is 
founded on past experience, and on our remembrance of their constant 
conjunction, the next question is, Whether experience produces the idea by means 
of the understanding or imagination; whether we are determin'd by reason to make 
the transition, or by a certain association and relation of perceptions. If 
reason determined us, it wou'd proceed upon that principle, that instances, of 
which we have had no experience, must resemble those, of which we have had 
experience, and that the course of nature continues always uniformly the same. 
In order therefore to clear up this matter, let us consider all the arguments, 
upon which such a proposition may be suppos'd to be founded; and as these must 
be deriv'd either from knowledge or probability, let us cast our eve on each of 
these degrees of evidence, and see whether they afford any just conclusion of 
this nature. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our foregoing method of reasoning will easily convince us, that there can 
be no demonstrative arguments to prove, that those instances, of which we have, 
had no experience, resemble those, of which we have had experience. We can at 
least conceive a change in the course of nature; which sufficiently proves, that 
such a change is not absolutely impossible. To form a clear idea of any thing, 
is an undeniable argument for its possibility, and is alone a refutation of any 
pretended demonstration against it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probability, as it discovers not the relations of ideas, considered as 
such, but only those of objects, must in some respects be founded on the 
impressions of our memory and senses, and in some respects on our ideas. Were 
there no mixture of any impression in our probable reasonings, the conclusion 
wou'd be entirely chimerical: And were there no mixture of ideas, the action of 
the mind, in observing the relation, wou'd, properly speaking, be sensation, not 
reasoning. 'Tis therefore necessary, that in all probable reasonings there be 
something present to the mind, either seen or remember'd; and that from this we 
infer something connected with it, which is not seen nor remember'd. </p>
