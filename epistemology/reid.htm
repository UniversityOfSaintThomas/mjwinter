<p><b>ESSAYS ON THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS OF MAN</b><br>
By Thomas Reid<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>ESSAY 2: The powers we have by means of our external senses</p>
<p><b>Chapter 5: Perception</b><br>
When we speak of the impressions made on our organs in perception, we are 
relying on facts<br>
taken from anatomy and physiology - facts for which we have the testimony of our 
senses. But<br>
now we are to speak of perception itself, ·not merely something that happens in 
perception·. And<br>
perception is solely an act of the mind, so we must appeal to some authority 
other than anatomy<br>
and physiology. The operations of our minds are known not through the senses but 
by<br>
consciousness, the authority of which is as certain and as irresistible as that 
of the senses.<br>
Everyone is conscious of the operations of his own mind; for us to have a clear 
notion of any<br>
of those operations of our own minds we need more than mere consciousness. We 
also have to<br>
attend to them while they are going on, and reflect on them carefully when 
they are recent and<br>
fresh in our memory; and we need to do this often enough for us to get the habit 
of this sort of<br>
attention and reflection. Thus, when I make some factual claim on this topic, I 
can only appeal to<br>
your thoughts, asking whether my claims don’t square with what you are conscious 
of in your<br>
own mind.<br>
Well, now, if we attend to the act of our mind that we call ‘perceiving an 
external object of<br>
sense’ we shall find in it these three things: (1) Some conception or notion of 
the object<br>
perceived. (2) A strong and irresistible conviction and belief that the object 
does at present exist.<br>
(3) That this conviction and belief are immediate, and not upshots of reasoning. 
·I shall discuss<br>
these in turn·.<br>
(1) It is impossible to perceive an object without having some notion or 
conception of the<br>
thing we perceive. We can indeed conceive an object that we don’t perceive; but 
when we<br>
perceive the object we must have some conception of it at the same time, and 
usually we have a<br>
clearer and steadier notion of the object while we perceive it than we get from 
memory or<br>
imagination at a time when we aren’t perceiving it. Yet even during perception 
the notion our<br>
senses give us of the object may be extremely clear, extremely unclear, or 
something in between.<br>
[Reid then comments on the variations in how well we see something, depending on 
distance,<br>
light conditions, naked eye versus microscope, and so on. He says that all this 
can easily be reapplied<br>
to the other senses, and that this is obvious to anyone who can reflect at all. 
Then:]<br>
I need only add that the notion we get of an object merely by our external sense 
mustn’t be<br>
confused with the more scientific notion that an adult may have of the same 
object by attending to<br>
its various attributes, or to its various parts and their relation to each other 
and to the whole. Thus<br>
the notion that a child has of a mechanical spit for roasting meat will 
obviously be very different<br>
from that of a man who understands the thing’s construction and perceives how 
its parts relate to<br>
one another and to the whole thing. The child sees the apparatus and every part 
of it as well as the<br>
man does, so the child has all the notion of it that sight can give; and 
whatever else there is in the<br>
adult’s notion of the apparatus must be derived ·not from sight but· from other 
powers of the<br>
mind . . . . We should be careful not to run together the operations of 
different powers of the mind<br>
- powers that apt to be taken as one and the same because in our adult years 
they are always<br>
conjoined.<br>
48<br>
(2) In perception we have not only a more or less clear notion of the perceived 
object but<br>
also an irresistible belief that it exists. This is always the case when we are 
sure that we perceive<br>
it. A perception can be so faint and indistinct that we aren’t sure whether we 
perceive the object<br>
or not. For example, when a star begins to twinkle as the light of the sun 
fades, you may for a<br>
short time think you see it without being sure that you do, until the 
perception acquires some<br>
strength and steadiness. . . . But when the perception is in any degree clear 
and steady, there<br>
remains no doubt of its reality, in which case the existence of the perceived 
object is also past<br>
doubt.<br>
[Reid then says that in every country’s law-courts witnesses may be challenged 
as liars, but<br>
never on the grounds that ‘the testimony of their eyes and ears’ shouldn’t be 
trusted. If any<br>
counsel ‘dared to offer such an argument . . . it would be rejected with 
disdain’. Then:] There<br>
couldn’t be stronger proof that it is the universal judgment of mankind that<br>
the evidence of the senses is a kind of evidence that we can safely depend on in 
the most<br>
momentous concerns of mankind, a kind of evidence against which we ought not to 
allow<br>
any reasoning; and therefore to reason against it - or to reason for it - is an 
insult to<br>
common sense.<br>
The whole conduct of mankind in everyday life, as well as in the solemn 
procedure of courts in<br>
the trial of civil and criminal cases, demonstrates this. I know only of two 
exceptions that may be<br>
offered against this being the universal belief of mankind.<br>
The first exception is that of some lunatics who become convinced of things that 
seem to<br>
contradict the clear testimony of their senses - e.g. one who seriously believed 
he was made of<br>
glass, and lived in continual terror of breaking. Well, our minds as well as our 
bodies are - in our<br>
present ·earthly· state - liable to strange disorders; and just as we don’t 
judge concerning the<br>
natural constitution of the body from the disorders or diseases that may come 
its way, so we<br>
oughtn’t to judge concerning the natural powers of the mind on the basis of its 
disorders rather<br>
than from its sound state. . . . It is natural for man to have faculties 
superior to those of brutes; yet<br>
we see some individuals whose faculties are not equal to those of many brutes; 
and the wisest man<br>
can by various accidents be reduced to this state. General rules about those 
whose intellects are<br>
sound are not overthrown by instances of men whose intellects are not sound.<br>
The other exception is that created by some philosophers who have maintained 
that the<br>
testimony of the senses is deceptive and therefore should never be trusted. 
Perhaps it is a<br>
sufficient answer to this to say that there is nothing so absurd that no 
philosophers have<br>
maintained it! It is one thing to proclaim a doctrine of this kind, another 
seriously to believe it and<br>
live by it. Obviously a man who didn’t believe his senses couldn’t keep out of 
harm’s way for an<br>
hour; yet in all the history of philosophy we never read of any sceptic who 
walked into fire or<br>
water because he didn’t believe his senses! . . . . We are entitled to think 
that philosophy was<br>
never able to conquer men’s natural belief in their senses, and that sceptical 
philosophers, in all<br>
their subtle reasonings against this belief, were never able to persuade 
themselves.<br>
So it appears that the clear and distinct testimony of our senses carries 
irresistible conviction<br>
along with it to every man who is in his right mind.<br>
(3) This conviction is not only irresistible but is immediate. It is not by 
reasoning and<br>
argumentation that we come to be convinced of the existence of what we perceive; 
the only<br>
argument we want for the object’s existence is that we perceive it. Perception 
commands our<br>
belief on its own authority, and doesn’t condescend to base its authority on any 
reasoning<br>
whatsoever.<br>
49<br>
·Don’t think that point (3) follows from point (2), because it doesn’t·. A 
belief can irresistible<br>
without being immediate. For example, my conviction that the three angles of 
every plane triangle<br>
are equal to two right angles is irresistible, but it isn’t immediate: I am 
convinced of it ·only· by<br>
demonstrative reasoning. There are other truths in mathematics of which we have 
a conviction<br>
that is not only irresistible but also immediate. The axioms are like that. Our 
belief in the axioms<br>
of mathematics isn’t based on argument. Arguments are based on the axioms, but 
their<br>
evidentness is discerned immediately by the human understanding.<br>
It is one thing to have an immediate conviction of a self-evident axiom, and 
another thing to<br>
have an immediate conviction of the existence of what we see. But the conviction 
is equally<br>
immediate and equally irresistible in both cases. No man thinks of looking for 
reasons to believe in<br>
what he sees; and we trust our senses just as much before we are capable of 
reasoning as we do<br>
afterwards. . . . The constitution of our understanding causes us to accept the 
truth of a<br>
mathematical axiom, regarding it as a first principle from which other truths 
can be deduced but<br>
isn’t itself deduced from anything; and the constitution of our power of 
perception causes us to<br>
accept the existence of what we clearly perceive, regarding it as a first 
principle from which other<br>
truths can be deduced but isn’t itself deduced from anything.<br>
[All this, Reid says, holds only for adults. Children don’t have a clear line 
between what is<br>
imagined and what is perceived, and anyway they may be incapable of having any 
notion as<br>
abstract as that of existence. Then:]<br>
The account I have given of our perception of external objects is intended as a 
faithful<br>
portrayal of what every adult man who is capable of attending to what passes in 
his own mind can<br>
feel in himself. How do our senses produce the notion of external objects and 
the immediate belief<br>
in their existence? I can’t tell you, and I don’t claim to be able to do so. If 
the power of perceiving<br>
external objects in certain circumstances is a part of the original constitution 
of the human mind -<br>
·part of its basic design· - then all attempts to account for it will be vain. 
The only explanation we<br>
can give for the constitution of things is ‘They are like that because God 
willed that they should<br>
be so’. Just as we can give no reason why matter is extended and inert, why the 
mind thinks and is<br>
conscious of its thoughts, except ‘That was the choice of God, who made both 
matter and mind’.<br>
. . .<br>
God intended us to have such knowledge of the material objects that surround us 
as we need<br>
for supplying our natural wants and avoiding the dangers to which we are 
constantly exposed; and<br>
he has admirably fitted our powers of perception to this purpose. If the news we 
get about<br>
external objects could be acquired only through reasoning, the majority of men 
wouldn’t have it;<br>
for the majority hardly ever learn to reason; and in infancy and childhood 
no-one can reason. . . .<br>
So God in his wisdom conveys news of external objects to us in a way that puts 
us all on a level.<br>
The information of the senses is as perfect, and gives as full conviction, to 
the most ignorant as to<br>
the most learned.<br>
