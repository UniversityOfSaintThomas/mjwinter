much reality in the efficient and total cause as in its effect; for whence
can the effect draw its reality if not from its cause ? And how could the
cause communicate to it this reality unless it possessed it in itself 7 And
hence it follows, not only that what is cannot be produced by what is not,
but likewise that the more perfect, in other words, that which contains in
itself more reality, cannot be the effect of the less perfect; and this is
not only evidently true of those effects, whose reality is actual or formal,
but likewise of ideas, whose reality is only considered as objective....</font></pre>

16. And in proportion to the time and care with which I examine all those
matters, the conviction of their truth brightens and becomes distinct. But,
to sum up, what conclusion shall I draw from it all? It is this: if the
objective reality [or perfection] of any one of my ideas be such as clearly
to convince me, that this same reality exists in me neither formally nor
eminently, and if, as follows from this, I myself cannot be the cause of it,
it is a necessary consequence that I am not alone in the world, but that
there is besides myself some other being who exists as the cause of that
idea; while, on the contrary, if no such idea be found in my mind, I shall
have no sufficient ground of assurance of the existence of any other being
besides myself, for, after a most careful search, I have, up to this moment,
been unable to discover any other ground.[L][F]
