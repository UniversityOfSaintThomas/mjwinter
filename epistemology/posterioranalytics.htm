	<b>Part 1</b> <br>
	<br>
	All instruction given or received by way of argument proceeds from 
	pre-existent knowledge. This becomes evident upon a survey of all the 
	species of such instruction. The mathematical sciences and all other 
	speculative disciplines are acquired in this way, and so are the two forms 
	of dialectical reasoning, syllogistic and inductive; for each of these 
	latter make use of old knowledge to impart new, the syllogism assuming an 
	audience that accepts its premisses, induction exhibiting the universal as 
	implicit in the clearly known particular. Again, the persuasion exerted by 
	rhetorical arguments is in principle the same, since they use either 
	example, a kind of induction, or enthymeme, a form of syllogism. <br>
	<br>
	The pre-existent knowledge required is of two kinds. In some cases admission 
	of the fact must be assumed, in others comprehension of the meaning of the 
	term used, and sometimes both assumptions are essential. Thus, we assume 
	that every predicate can be either truly affirmed or truly denied of any 
	subject, and that 'triangle' means so and so; as regards 'unit' we have to 
	make the double assumption of the meaning of the word and the existence of 
	the thing. The reason is that these several objects are not equally obvious 
	to us. Recognition of a truth may in some cases contain as factors both 
	previous knowledge and also knowledge acquired simultaneously with that 
	recognition-knowledge, this latter, of the particulars actually falling 
	under the universal and therein already virtually known. For example, the 
	student knew beforehand that the angles of every triangle are equal to two 
	right angles; but it was only at the actual moment at which he was being led 
	on to recognize this as true in the instance before him that he came to know 
	'this figure inscribed in the semicircle' to be a triangle. For some things 
	(viz. the singulars finally reached which are not predicable of anything 
	else as subject) are only learnt in this way, i.e. there is here no 
	recognition through a middle of a minor term as subject to a major. Before 
	he was led on to recognition or before he actually drew a conclusion, we 
	should perhaps say that in a manner he knew, in a manner not. <br>
	<br>
	If he did not in an unqualified sense of the term know the existence of this 
	triangle, how could he know without qualification that its angles were equal 
	to two right angles? No: clearly he knows not without qualification but only 
	in the sense that he knows universally. If this distinction is not drawn, we 
	are faced with the dilemma in the Meno: either a man will learn nothing or 
	what he already knows; for we cannot accept the solution which some people 
	offer. A man is asked, 'Do you, or do you not, know that every pair is 
	even?' He says he does know it. The questioner then produces a particular 
	pair, of the existence, and so a fortiori of the evenness, of which he was 
	unaware. The solution which some people offer is to assert that they do not 
	know that every pair is even, but only that everything which they know to be 
	a pair is even: yet what they know to be even is that of which they have 
	demonstrated evenness, i.e. what they made the subject of their premiss, 
	viz. not merely every triangle or number which they know to be such, but any 
	and every number or triangle without reservation. For no premiss is ever 
	couched in the form 'every number which you know to be such', or 'every 
	rectilinear figure which you know to be such': the predicate is always 
	construed as applicable to any and every instance of the thing. On the other 
	hand, I imagine there is nothing to prevent a man in one sense knowing what 
	he is learning, in another not knowing it. The strange thing would be, not 
	if in some sense he knew what he was learning, but if he were to know it in 
	that precise sense and manner in which he was learning it. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Part 2</b> <br>
	<br>
	We suppose ourselves to possess unqualified scientific knowledge of a thing, 
	as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the sophist knows, 
	when we think that we know the cause on which the fact depends, as the cause 
	of that fact and of no other, and, further, that the fact could not be other 
	than it is. Now that scientific knowing is something of this sort is 
	evident-witness both those who falsely claim it and those who actually 
	possess it, since the former merely imagine themselves to be, while the 
	latter are also actually, in the condition described. Consequently the 
	proper object of unqualified scientific knowledge is something which cannot 
	be other than it is. <br>
	<br>
	There may be another manner of knowing as well-that will be discussed later. 
	What I now assert is that at all events we do know by demonstration. By 
	demonstration I mean a syllogism productive of scientific knowledge, a 
	syllogism, that is, the grasp of which is eo ipso such knowledge. Assuming 
	then that my thesis as to the nature of scientific knowing is correct, the 
	premisses of demonstrated knowledge must be true, primary, immediate, better 
	known than and prior to the conclusion, which is further related to them as 
	effect to cause. Unless these conditions are satisfied, the basic truths 
	will not be 'appropriate' to the conclusion. Syllogism there may indeed be 
	without these conditions, but such syllogism, not being productive of 
	scientific knowledge, will not be demonstration. The premisses must be true: 
	for that which is non-existent cannot be known-we cannot know, e.g. that the 
	diagonal of a square is commensurate with its side. The premisses must be 
	primary and indemonstrable; otherwise they will require demonstration in 
	order to be known, since to have knowledge, if it be not accidental 
	knowledge, of things which are demonstrable, means precisely to have a 
	demonstration of them. The premisses must be the causes of the conclusion, 
	better known than it, and prior to it; its causes, since we possess 
	scientific knowledge of a thing only when we know its cause; prior, in order 
	to be causes; antecedently known, this antecedent knowledge being not our 
	mere understanding of the meaning, but knowledge of the fact as well. Now 
	'prior' and 'better known' are ambiguous terms, for there is a difference 
	between what is prior and better known in the order of being and what is 
	prior and better known to man. I mean that objects nearer to sense are prior 
	and better known to man; objects without qualification prior and better 
	known are those further from sense. Now the most universal causes are 
	furthest from sense and particular causes are nearest to sense, and they are 
	thus exactly opposed to one another. In saying that the premisses of 
	demonstrated knowledge must be primary, I mean that they must be the 
	'appropriate' basic truths, for I identify primary premiss and basic truth. 
	A 'basic truth' in a demonstration is an immediate proposition. An immediate 
	proposition is one which has no other proposition prior to it. A proposition 
	is either part of an enunciation, i.e. it predicates a single attribute of a 
	single subject. If a proposition is dialectical, it assumes either part 
	indifferently; if it is demonstrative, it lays down one part to the definite 
	exclusion of the other because that part is true. The term 'enunciation' 
	denotes either part of a contradiction indifferently. A contradiction is an 
	opposition which of its own nature excludes a middle. The part of a 
	contradiction which conjoins a predicate with a subject is an affirmation; 
	the part disjoining them is a negation. I call an immediate basic truth of 
	syllogism a 'thesis' when, though it is not susceptible of proof by the 
	teacher, yet ignorance of it does not constitute a total bar to progress on 
	the part of the pupil: one which the pupil must know if he is to learn 
	anything whatever is an axiom. I call it an axiom because there are such 
	truths and we give them the name of axioms par excellence. If a thesis 
	assumes one part or the other of an enunciation, i.e. asserts either the 
	existence or the non-existence of a subject, it is a hypothesis; if it does 
	not so assert, it is a definition. Definition is a 'thesis' or a 'laying 
	something down', since the arithmetician lays it down that to be a unit is 
	to be quantitatively indivisible; but it is not a hypothesis, for to define 
	what a unit is is not the same as to affirm its existence. <br>
	<br>
	Now since the required ground of our knowledge-i.e. of our conviction-of a 
	fact is the possession of such a syllogism as we call demonstration, and the 
	ground of the syllogism is the facts constituting its premisses, we must not 
	only know the primary premisses-some if not all of them-beforehand, but know 
	them better than the conclusion: for the cause of an attribute's inherence 
	in a subject always itself inheres in the subject more firmly than that 
	attribute; e.g. the cause of our loving anything is dearer to us than the 
	object of our love. So since the primary premisses are the cause of our 
	knowledge-i.e. of our conviction-it follows that we know them better-that 
	is, are more convinced of them-than their consequences, precisely because of 
	our knowledge of the latter is the effect of our knowledge of the premisses. 
	Now a man cannot believe in anything more than in the things he knows, 
	unless he has either actual knowledge of it or something better than actual 
	knowledge. But we are faced with this paradox if a student whose belief 
	rests on demonstration has not prior knowledge; a man must believe in some, 
	if not in all, of the basic truths more than in the conclusion. Moreover, if 
	a man sets out to acquire the scientific knowledge that comes through 
	demonstration, he must not only have a better knowledge of the basic truths 
	and a firmer conviction of them than of the connexion which is being 
	demonstrated: more than this, nothing must be more certain or better known 
	to him than these basic truths in their character as contradicting the 
	fundamental premisses which lead to the opposed and erroneous conclusion. 
	For indeed the conviction of pure science must be unshakable. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Part 3</b> <br>
	<br>
	Some hold that, owing to the necessity of knowing the primary premisses, 
	there is no scientific knowledge. Others think there is, but that all truths 
	are demonstrable. Neither doctrine is either true or a necessary deduction 
	from the premisses. The first school, assuming that there is no way of 
	knowing other than by demonstration, maintain that an infinite regress is 
	involved, on the ground that if behind the prior stands no primary, we could 
	not know the posterior through the prior (wherein they are right, for one 
	cannot traverse an infinite series): if on the other hand-they say-the 
	series terminates and there are primary premisses, yet these are unknowable 
	because incapable of demonstration, which according to them is the only form 
	of knowledge. And since thus one cannot know the primary premisses, 
	knowledge of the conclusions which follow from them is not pure scientific 
	knowledge nor properly knowing at all, but rests on the mere supposition 
	that the premisses are true. The other party agree with them as regards 
	knowing, holding that it is only possible by demonstration, but they see no 
	difficulty in holding that all truths are demonstrated, on the ground that 
	demonstration may be circular and reciprocal. <br>
	<br>
	Our own doctrine is that not all knowledge is demonstrative: on the 
	contrary, knowledge of the immediate premisses is independent of 
	demonstration. (The necessity of this is obvious; for since we must know the 
	prior premisses from which the demonstration is drawn, and since the regress 
	must end in immediate truths, those truths must be indemonstrable.) Such, 
	then, is our doctrine, and in addition we maintain that besides scientific 
	knowledge there is its originative source which enables us to recognize the 
	definitions. <br>
	<br>
	Now demonstration must be based on premisses prior to and better known than 
	the conclusion; and the same things cannot simultaneously be both prior and 
	posterior to one another: so circular demonstration is clearly not possible 
	in the unqualified sense of 'demonstration', but only possible if 
	'demonstration' be extended to include that other method of argument which 
	rests on a distinction between truths prior to us and truths without 
	qualification prior, i.e. the method by which induction produces knowledge. 
	But if we accept this extension of its meaning, our definition of 
	unqualified knowledge will prove faulty; for there seem to be two kinds of 
	it. Perhaps, however, the second form of demonstration, that which proceeds 
	from truths better known to us, is not demonstration in the unqualified 
	sense of the term. <br>
	<br>
	The advocates of circular demonstration are not only faced with the 
	difficulty we have just stated: in addition their theory reduces to the mere 
	statement that if a thing exists, then it does exist-an easy way of proving 
	anything. That this is so can be clearly shown by taking three terms, for to 
	constitute the circle it makes no difference whether many terms or few or 
	even only two are taken. Thus by direct proof, if A is, B must be; if B is, 
	C must be; therefore if A is, C must be. Since then-by the circular proof-if 
	A is, B must be, and if B is, A must be, A may be substituted for C above. 
	Then 'if B is, A must be'='if B is, C must be', which above gave the 
	conclusion 'if A is, C must be': but C and A have been identified. 
	Consequently the upholders of circular demonstration are in the position of 
	saying that if A is, A must be-a simple way of proving anything. Moreover, 
	even such circular demonstration is impossible except in the case of 
	attributes that imply one another, viz. 'peculiar' properties. <br>
	<br>
	Now, it has been shown that the positing of one thing-be it one term or one 
	premiss-never involves a necessary consequent: two premisses constitute the 
	first and smallest foundation for drawing a conclusion at all and therefore 
	a fortiori for the demonstrative syllogism of science. If, then, A is 
	implied in B and C, and B and C are reciprocally implied in one another and 
	in A, it is possible, as has been shown in my writings on the syllogism, to 
	prove all the assumptions on which the original conclusion rested, by 
	circular demonstration in the first figure. But it has also been shown that 
	in the other figures either no conclusion is possible, or at least none 
	which proves both the original premisses. Propositions the terms of which 
	are not convertible cannot be circularly demonstrated at all, and since 
	convertible terms occur rarely in actual demonstrations, it is clearly 
	frivolous and impossible to say that demonstration is reciprocal and that 
	therefore everything can be demonstrated. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Part 4</b> <br>
	<br>
	Since the object of pure scientific knowledge cannot be other than it is, 
	the truth obtained by demonstrative knowledge will be necessary. And since 
	demonstrative knowledge is only present when we have a demonstration, it 
	follows that demonstration is an inference from necessary premisses. So we 
	must consider what are the premisses of demonstration-i.e. what is their 
	character: and as a preliminary, let us define what we mean by an attribute 
	'true in every instance of its subject', an 'essential' attribute, and a 
	'commensurate and universal' attribute. I call 'true in every instance' what 
	is truly predicable of all instances-not of one to the exclusion of 
	others-and at all times, not at this or that time only; e.g. if animal is 
	truly predicable of every instance of man, then if it be true to say 'this 
	is a man', 'this is an animal' is also true, and if the one be true now the 
	other is true now. A corresponding account holds if point is in every 
	instance predicable as contained in line. There is evidence for this in the 
	fact that the objection we raise against a proposition put to us as true in 
	every instance is either an instance in which, or an occasion on which, it 
	is not true. Essential attributes are (1) such as belong to their subject as 
	elements in its essential nature (e.g. line thus belongs to triangle, point 
	to line; for the very being or 'substance' of triangle and line is composed 
	of these elements, which are contained in the formulae defining triangle and 
	line): (2) such that, while they belong to certain subjects, the subjects to 
	which they belong are contained in the attribute's own defining formula. 
	Thus straight and curved belong to line, odd and even, prime and compound, 
	square and oblong, to number; and also the formula defining any one of these 
	attributes contains its subject-e.g. line or number as the case may be. <br>
	<br>
	Extending this classification to all other attributes, I distinguish those 
	that answer the above description as belonging essentially to their 
	respective subjects; whereas attributes related in neither of these two ways 
	to their subjects I call accidents or 'coincidents'; e.g. musical or white 
	is a 'coincident' of animal. <br>
	<br>
	Further (a) that is essential which is not predicated of a subject other 
	than itself: e.g. 'the walking [thing]' walks and is white in virtue of 
	being something else besides; whereas substance, in the sense of whatever 
	signifies a 'this somewhat', is not what it is in virtue of being something 
	else besides. Things, then, not predicated of a subject I call essential; 
	things predicated of a subject I call accidental or 'coincidental'. <br>
	<br>
	In another sense again (b) a thing consequentially connected with anything 
	is essential; one not so connected is 'coincidental'. An example of the 
	latter is 'While he was walking it lightened': the lightning was not due to 
	his walking; it was, we should say, a coincidence. If, on the other hand, 
	there is a consequential connexion, the predication is essential; e.g. if a 
	beast dies when its throat is being cut, then its death is also essentially 
	connected with the cutting, because the cutting was the cause of death, not 
	death a 'coincident' of the cutting. <br>
	<br>
	So far then as concerns the sphere of connexions scientifically known in the 
	unqualified sense of that term, all attributes which (within that sphere) 
	are essential either in the sense that their subjects are contained in them, 
	or in the sense that they are contained in their subjects, are necessary as 
	well as consequentially connected with their subjects. For it is impossible 
	for them not to inhere in their subjects either simply or in the qualified 
	sense that one or other of a pair of opposites must inhere in the subject; 
	e.g. in line must be either straightness or curvature, in number either 
	oddness or evenness. For within a single identical genus the contrary of a 
	given attribute is either its privative or its contradictory; e.g. within 
	number what is not odd is even, inasmuch as within this sphere even is a 
	necessary consequent of not-odd. So, since any given predicate must be 
	either affirmed or denied of any subject, essential attributes must inhere 
	in their subjects of necessity. <br>
	<br>
	Thus, then, we have established the distinction between the attribute which 
	is 'true in every instance' and the 'essential' attribute. <br>
	<br>
	I term 'commensurately universal' an attribute which belongs to every 
	instance of its subject, and to every instance essentially and as such; from 
	which it clearly follows that all commensurate universals inhere necessarily 
	in their subjects. The essential attribute, and the attribute that belongs 
	to its subject as such, are identical. E.g. point and straight belong to 
	line essentially, for they belong to line as such; and triangle as such has 
	two right angles, for it is essentially equal to two right angles. <br>
	<br>
	An attribute belongs commensurately and universally to a subject when it can 
	be shown to belong to any random instance of that subject and when the 
	subject is the first thing to which it can be shown to belong. Thus, e.g. 
	(1) the equality of its angles to two right angles is not a commensurately 
	universal attribute of figure. For though it is possible to show that a 
	figure has its angles equal to two right angles, this attribute cannot be 
	demonstrated of any figure selected at haphazard, nor in demonstrating does 
	one take a figure at random-a square is a figure but its angles are not 
	equal to two right angles. On the other hand, any isosceles triangle has its 
	angles equal to two right angles, yet isosceles triangle is not the primary 
	subject of this attribute but triangle is prior. So whatever can be shown to 
	have its angles equal to two right angles, or to possess any other 
	attribute, in any random instance of itself and primarily-that is the first 
	subject to which the predicate in question belongs commensurately and 
	universally, and the demonstration, in the essential sense, of any predicate 
	is the proof of it as belonging to this first subject commensurately and 
	universally: while the proof of it as belonging to the other subjects to 
	which it attaches is demonstration only in a secondary and unessential 
	sense. Nor again (2) is equality to two right angles a commensurately 
	universal attribute of isosceles; it is of wider application. <br>
	<br>
	(Part 5 omitted)<br>
	<br>
	<b>Part 6</b> <br>
	<br>
	Demonstrative knowledge must rest on necessary basic truths; for the object 
	of scientific knowledge cannot be other than it is. Now attributes attaching 
	essentially to their subjects attach necessarily to them: for essential 
	attributes are either elements in the essential nature of their subjects, or 
	contain their subjects as elements in their own essential nature. (The pairs 
	of opposites which the latter class includes are necessary because one 
	member or the other necessarily inheres.) It follows from this that 
	premisses of the demonstrative syllogism must be connexions essential in the 
	sense explained: for all attributes must inhere essentially or else be 
	accidental, and accidental attributes are not necessary to their subjects.
	<br>
	<br>
	We must either state the case thus, or else premise that the conclusion of 
	demonstration is necessary and that a demonstrated conclusion cannot be 
	other than it is, and then infer that the conclusion must be developed from 
	necessary premisses. For though you may reason from true premisses without 
	demonstrating, yet if your premisses are necessary you will assuredly 
	demonstrate-in such necessity you have at once a distinctive character of 
	demonstration. That demonstration proceeds from necessary premisses is also 
	indicated by the fact that the objection we raise against a professed 
	demonstration is that a premiss of it is not a necessary truth-whether we 
	think it altogether devoid of necessity, or at any rate so far as our 
	opponent's previous argument goes. This shows how naive it is to suppose 
	one's basic truths rightly chosen if one starts with a proposition which is 
	(1) popularly accepted and (2) true, such as the sophists' assumption that 
	to know is the same as to possess knowledge. For (1) popular acceptance or 
	rejection is no criterion of a basic truth, which can only be the primary 
	law of the genus constituting the subject matter of the demonstration; and 
	(2) not all truth is 'appropriate'. <br>
	<br>
	A further proof that the conclusion must be the development of necessary 
	premisses is as follows. Where demonstration is possible, one who can give 
	no account which includes the cause has no scientific knowledge. If, then, 
	we suppose a syllogism in which, though A necessarily inheres in C, yet B, 
	the middle term of the demonstration, is not necessarily connected with A 
	and C, then the man who argues thus has no reasoned knowledge of the 
	conclusion, since this conclusion does not owe its necessity to the middle 
	term; for though the conclusion is necessary, the mediating link is a 
	contingent fact. Or again, if a man is without knowledge now, though he 
	still retains the steps of the argument, though there is no change in 
	himself or in the fact and no lapse of memory on his part; then neither had 
	he knowledge previously. But the mediating link, not being necessary, may 
	have perished in the interval; and if so, though there be no change in him 
	nor in the fact, and though he will still retain the steps of the argument, 
	yet he has not knowledge, and therefore had not knowledge before. Even if 
	the link has not actually perished but is liable to perish, this situation 
	is possible and might occur. But such a condition cannot be knowledge. <br>
	<br>
	When the conclusion is necessary, the middle through which it was proved may 
	yet quite easily be non-necessary. You can in fact infer the necessary even 
	from a non-necessary premiss, just as you can infer the true from the not 
	true. On the other hand, when the middle is necessary the conclusion must be 
	necessary; just as true premisses always give a true conclusion. Thus, if A 
	is necessarily predicated of B and B of C, then A is necessarily predicated 
	of C. But when the conclusion is nonnecessary the middle cannot be necessary 
	either. Thus: let A be predicated non-necessarily of C but necessarily of B, 
	and let B be a necessary predicate of C; then A too will be a necessary 
	predicate of C, which by hypothesis it is not. <br>
	<br>
	To sum up, then: demonstrative knowledge must be knowledge of a necessary 
	nexus, and therefore must clearly be obtained through a necessary middle 
	term; otherwise its possessor will know neither the cause nor the fact that 
	his conclusion is a necessary connexion. Either he will mistake the 
	non-necessary for the necessary and believe the necessity of the conclusion 
	without knowing it, or else he will not even believe it-in which case he 
	will be equally ignorant, whether he actually infers the mere fact through 
	middle terms or the reasoned fact and from immediate premisses. <br>
	<br>
	Of accidents that are not essential according to our definition of essential 
	there is no demonstrative knowledge; for since an accident, in the sense in 
	which I here speak of it, may also not inhere, it is impossible to prove its 
	inherence as a necessary conclusion. A difficulty, however, might be raised 
	as to why in dialectic, if the conclusion is not a necessary connexion, such 
	and such determinate premisses should be proposed in order to deal with such 
	and such determinate problems. Would not the result be the same if one asked 
	any questions whatever and then merely stated one's conclusion? The solution 
	is that determinate questions have to be put, not because the replies to 
	them affirm facts which necessitate facts affirmed by the conclusion, but 
	because these answers are propositions which if the answerer affirm, he must 
	affirm the conclusion and affirm it with truth if they are true. <br>
	<br>
	Since it is just those attributes within every genus which are essential and 
	possessed by their respective subjects as such that are necessary it is 
	clear that both the conclusions and the premisses of demonstrations which 
	produce scientific knowledge are essential. For accidents are not necessary: 
	and, further, since accidents are not necessary one does not necessarily 
	have reasoned knowledge of a conclusion drawn from them (this is so even if 
	the accidental premisses are invariable but not essential, as in proofs 
	through signs; for though the conclusion be actually essential, one will not 
	know it as essential nor know its reason); but to have reasoned knowledge of 
	a conclusion is to know it through its cause. We may conclude that the 
	middle must be consequentially connected with the minor, and the major with 
	the middle. <br>

<br>
As regards syllogism and demonstration, the definition of, and the conditions 
required to produce each of them, are now clear, and with that also the 
definition of, and the conditions required to produce, demonstrative knowledge, 
since it is the same as demonstration. As to the basic premisses, how they 
become known and what is the developed state of knowledge of them is made clear 
by raising some preliminary problems. <br>
<br>
We have already said that scientific knowledge through demonstration is 
impossible unless a man knows the primary immediate premisses. But there are 
questions which might be raised in respect of the apprehension of these 
immediate premisses: one might not only ask whether it is of the same kind as 
the apprehension of the conclusions, but also whether there is or is not 
scientific knowledge of both; or scientific knowledge of the latter, and of the 
former a different kind of knowledge; and, further, whether the developed states 
of knowledge are not innate but come to be in us, or are innate but at first 
unnoticed. Now it is strange if we possess them from birth; for it means that we 
possess apprehensions more accurate than demonstration and fail to notice them. 
If on the other hand we acquire them and do not previously possess them, how 
could we apprehend and learn without a basis of pre-existent knowledge? For that 
is impossible, as we used to find in the case of demonstration. So it emerges 
that neither can we possess them from birth, nor can they come to be in us if we 
are without knowledge of them to the extent of having no such developed state at 
all. Therefore we must possess a capacity of some sort, but not such as to rank 
higher in accuracy than these developed states. And this at least is an obvious 
characteristic of all animals, for they possess a congenital discriminative 
capacity which is called sense-perception. But though sense-perception is innate 
in all animals, in some the sense-impression comes to persist, in others it does 
not. So animals in which this persistence does not come to be have either no 
knowledge at all outside the act of perceiving, or no knowledge of objects of 
which no impression persists; animals in which it does come into being have 
perception and can continue to retain the sense-impression in the soul: and when 
such persistence is frequently repeated a further distinction at once arises 
between those which out of the persistence of such sense-impressions develop a 
power of systematizing them and those which do not. So out of sense-perception 
comes to be what we call memory, and out of frequently repeated memories of the 
same thing develops experience; for a number of memories constitute a single 
experience. From experience again-i.e. from the universal now stabilized in its 
entirety within the soul, the one beside the many which is a single identity 
within them all-originate the skill of the craftsman and the knowledge of the 
man of science, skill in the sphere of coming to be and science in the sphere of 
being. <br>
<br>
We conclude that these states of knowledge are neither innate in a determinate 
form, nor developed from other higher states of knowledge, but from 
sense-perception. It is like a rout in battle stopped by first one man making a 
stand and then another, until the original formation has been restored. The soul 
is so constituted as to be capable of this process. <br>
<br>
Let us now restate the account given already, though with insufficient 
clearness. When one of a number of logically indiscriminable particulars has 
made a stand, the earliest universal is present in the soul: for though the act 
of sense-perception is of the particular, its content is universal-is man, for 
example, not the man Callias. A fresh stand is made among these rudimentary 
universals, and the process does not cease until the indivisible concepts, the 
true universals, are established: e.g. such and such a species of animal is a 
step towards the genus animal, which by the same process is a step towards a 
further generalization. <br>
<br>
Thus it is clear that we must get to know the primary premisses by induction; 
for the method by which even sense-perception implants the universal is 
inductive. Now of the thinking states by which we grasp truth, some are 
unfailingly true, others admit of error-opinion, for instance, and calculation, 
whereas scientific knowing and intuition are always true: further, no other kind 
of thought except intuition is more accurate than scientific knowledge, whereas 
primary premisses are more knowable than demonstrations, and all scientific 
knowledge is discursive. From these considerations it follows that there will be 
no scientific knowledge of the primary premisses, and since except intuition 
nothing can be truer than scientific knowledge, it will be intuition that 
apprehends the primary premisses-a result which also follows from the fact that 
demonstration cannot be the originative source of demonstration, nor, 
consequently, scientific knowledge of scientific knowledge.If, therefore, it is 
the only other kind of true thinking except scientific knowing, intuition will 
be the originative source of scientific knowledge. And the originative source of 
science grasps the original basic premiss, while science as a whole is similarly 
related as originative source to the whole body of fact. </p>
