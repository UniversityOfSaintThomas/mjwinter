<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by Plato</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; translated by Benjamin Jowett</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">THEAETETUS</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: SOCRATES; THEODORUS; 
THEAETETUS</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Euclid and Terpsion meet in front of Euclid's house in 
Megara; they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">enter the house, and the dialogue is read to them by a 
servant.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>142</b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Euclid. Have you only just arrived from the country, 
Terpsion?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Terpsion. No, I came some time ago: and I have been in 
the Agora</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">looking for you, and wondering that I could not find 
you.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Euc. But I was not in the city.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Terp. Where then?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Euc. As I was going down to the harbour, I met 
Theaetetus-he was</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">being carried up to Athens from the army at Corinth.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Terp. Was he alive or dead?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Euc. He was scarcely alive, for he has been badly 
wounded; but he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">was suffering even more from the sickness which has 
broken out in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the army.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Terp. The dysentery, you mean?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Euc. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Terp. Alas! what a loss he will be!</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Euc. Yes, Terpsion, he is a noble fellow; only to-day 
I heard some</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">people highly praising his behaviour in this very 
battle.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Terp. No wonder; I should rather be surprised at 
hearing anything</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">else of him. But why did he go on, instead of stopping 
at Megara?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Euc. He wanted to get home: although I entreated and 
advised him</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to remain he would not listen to me; so I set him on his 
way, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">turned back, and then I remembered what Socrates had 
said of him,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and thought how remarkably this, like all his 
predictions, had been</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">fulfilled. I believe that he had seen him a little 
before his own</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">death, when Theaetetus was a youth, and he had a 
memorable</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">conversation with him, which he repeated to me when I 
came to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Athens; he was full of admiration of his genius, and 
said that he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">would most certainly be a great man, if he lived.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Terp. The prophecy has certainly been fulfilled; but 
what was the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">conversation? can you tell me?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;<b>143</b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;Euc. No, indeed, not offhand; but I took notes of 
it as soon as I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">got home; these I filled up from memory, writing them 
out at</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">leisure; and whenever I went to Athens, I asked Socrates 
about any</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">point which I had forgotten, and on my return I made 
corrections; thus</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I have nearly the whole conversation written down.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Terp. I remember-you told me; and I have always been 
intending to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ask you to show me the writing, but have put off doing 
so; and now,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">why should we not read it through?-having just come from 
the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">country, I should greatly like to rest.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Euc. I too shall be very glad of a rest, for I went 
with</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theaetetus as far as Erineum. Let us go in, then, and, 
while we are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">reposing, the servant shall read to us.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Terp. Very good.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Euc. Here is the roll, Terpsion; I may observe that I 
have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">introduced Socrates, not as narrating to me, but as 
actually</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">conversing with the persons whom he mentioned-these 
were, Theodorus</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the geometrician (of Cyrene), and Theaetetus. I have 
omitted, for</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the sake of convenience, the interlocutory words &quot;I 
said,&quot; &quot;I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">remarked,&quot; which he used when he spoke of himself, and 
again, &quot;he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">agreed,&quot; or &quot;disagreed,&quot; in the answer, lest the 
repetition of them</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">should be troublesome.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Terp. Quite right, Euclid.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Euc. And now, boy, you may take the roll and read.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Euclid's servant reads.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Socrates. If I cared enough about the Cyrenians, 
Theodorus, I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">would ask you whether there are any rising geometricians 
or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">philosophers in that part of the world. But I am more 
interested in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">our own Athenian youth, and I would rather know who 
among them are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">likely to do well. I observe them as far as I can 
myself, and I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">enquire of any one whom they follow, and I see that a 
great many of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">them follow you, in which they are quite right, 
considering your</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">eminence in geometry and in other ways. Tell me then, if 
you have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">met with any one who is good for anything.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>144</b>&nbsp; Theodorus. Yes, Socrates, I have become 
acquainted with one very</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">remarkable Athenian youth, whom I commend to you as well 
worthy of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">your attention. If he had been a beauty I should have 
been afraid to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">praise him, lest you should suppose that I was in love 
with him; but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he is no beauty, and you must not be offended if I say 
that he is very</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">like you; for he has a snub nose and projecting eyes, 
although these</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">features are less marked in him than in you. Seeing, 
then, that he has</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">no personal attractions, I may freely say, that in all 
my</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">acquaintance, which is very large, I never knew anyone 
who was his</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">equal in natural gifts: for he has a quickness of 
apprehension which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is almost unrivalled, and he is exceedingly gentle, and 
also the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">most courageous of men; there is a union of qualities in 
him such as I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have never seen in any other, and should scarcely have 
thought</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">possible; for those who, like him, have quick and ready 
and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">retentive wits, have generally also quick tempers; they 
are ships</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">without ballast, and go darting about, and are mad 
rather than</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">courageous; and the steadier sort, when they have to 
face study, prove</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">stupid and cannot remember. Whereas he moves surely and 
smoothly and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">successfully in the path of knowledge and enquiry; and 
he is full of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">gentleness, flowing on silently like a river of oil; at 
his age, it is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wonderful.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. That is good news; whose son is he?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. The name of his father I have forgotten, but 
the youth</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">himself is the middle one of those who are approaching 
us; he and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">his companions have been anointing themselves in the 
outer court,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and now they seem to have finished, and are towards us. 
Look and see</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">whether you know him.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I know the youth, but I do not know his name; he 
is the son</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of Euphronius the Sunian, who was himself an eminent 
man, and such</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">another as his son is, according to your account of him; 
I believe</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that he left a considerable fortune.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Theaetetus, Socrates, is his name; but I rather 
think that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the property disappeared in the hands of trustees; 
notwithstanding</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which he is wonderfully liberal.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. He must be a fine fellow; tell him to come and 
sit by me.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. I will. Come hither, Theaetetus, and sit by 
Socrates.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. By all means, Theaetetus, in order that I may see 
the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">reflection of myself in your face, for Theodorus says 
that we are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">alike; and yet if each of us held in his hands a lyre, 
and he said</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that they were, tuned alike, should we at once take his 
word, or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">should we ask whether he who said so was or was not a 
musician?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaetetus. We should ask.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And if we found that he was, we should take his 
word; and if</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not, not?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;<b>145</b> Soc. And if this supposed, likeness of our 
faces is a matter of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">any interest to us we should enquire whether he who says 
that we are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">alike is a painter or not?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly we should.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And is Theodorus a painter?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I never heard that he was.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Is he a geometrician?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Of course he is, Socrates.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And is he an astronomer and calculator and 
musician, and in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">general an educated man?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I think so.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. If, then, he remarks on a similarity in our 
persons, either</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">by way of praise or blame, there is no particular reason 
why we should</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">attend to him.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I should say not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But if he praises the virtue or wisdom which are 
the mental</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">endowments of either of us, then he who hears the 
praises will</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">naturally desire to examine him who is praised: and he 
again should be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">willing to exhibit himself.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very true, Socrates.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then now is the time, my dear Theaetetus, for me 
to examine,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and for you to exhibit; since although Theodorus has 
praised many a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">citizen and stranger in my hearing, never did I hear him 
praise any</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one as he has been praising you.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I am glad to hear it, Socrates; but what if he 
was only in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">jest?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Nay, Theodorus is not given to jesting; and I 
cannot allow</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you to retract your consent on any such pretence as 
that. If you do,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he will have to swear to his words; and we are perfectly 
sure that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">no one will be found to impugn him. Do not be shy then, 
but stand to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">your word.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I suppose I must, if you wish it.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. In the first place, I should like to ask what you 
learn of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theodorus: something of geometry, perhaps?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And astronomy and harmony and calculation?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I do my best.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Yes, my boy, and so do I: and my desire is to 
learn of him,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">or of anybody who seems to understand these things. And 
I get on</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">pretty well in general; but there is a little difficulty 
which I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">want you and the company to aid me in investigating. 
Will you answer</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">me a question: &quot;Is not learning growing wiser about that 
which you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">learn?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Of course.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And by wisdom the wise are wise?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And is that different in any way from knowledge?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Wisdom; are not men wise in that which they know?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly they are.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then wisdom and knowledge are the same?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;<b>146</b> Soc. Herein lies the difficulty which I can 
never solve to my</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">satisfaction-What is knowledge? Can we answer that 
question? What</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">say you? which of us will speak first? whoever misses 
shall sit</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">down, as at a game of ball, and shall be donkey, as the 
boys say; he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">who lasts out his competitors in the game without 
missing, shall be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">our king, and shall have the right of putting to us any 
questions</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which he pleases. .. Why is there no reply? I hope, 
Theodorus, that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I am not betrayed into rudeness by my love of 
conversation? I only</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">want to make us talk and be friendly and sociable.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. The reverse of rudeness, Socrates: but I would 
rather that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you would ask one of the young fellows; for the truth 
is, that I am</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">unused to your game of question and answer, and I am too 
old to learn;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the young will be more suitable, and they will improve 
more than I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">shall, for youth is always able to improve. And so 
having made a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">beginning with Theaetetus, I would advise you to go on 
with him and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not let him off.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Do you hear, Theaetetus, what Theodorus says? The</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">philosopher, whom you would not like to disobey, and 
whose word</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ought to be a command to a young man, bids me 
interrogate you. Take</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">courage, then, and nobly say what you think that 
knowledge is.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Well, Socrates, I will answer as you and he 
bid me; and if</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">make a mistake, you will doubtless correct me.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. We will, if we can.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Then, I think that the sciences which I learn 
from</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theodorus-geometry, and those which you just now 
mentioned-are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge; and I would include the art of the cobbler 
and other</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">craftsmen; these, each and all of, them, are knowledge.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Too much, Theaetetus, too much; the nobility and 
liberality</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of your nature make you give many and diverse things, 
when I am asking</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">for one simple thing.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What do you mean, Socrates?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Perhaps nothing. I will endeavour, however, to 
explain what I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">believe to be my meaning: When you speak of cobbling, 
you mean the art</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">or science of making shoes?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Just so.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And when you speak of carpentering, you mean the 
art of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">making wooden implements?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I do.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. In both cases you define the subject matter of 
each of the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">two arts?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But that, Theaetetus, was not the point of my 
question: we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wanted to know not the subjects, nor yet the number of 
the arts or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sciences, for we were not going to count them, but we 
wanted to know</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the nature of knowledge in the abstract. Am I not right?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Perfectly right.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>147&nbsp;</b> Soc. Let me offer an illustration: Suppose 
that a person were to ask</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">about some very trivial and obvious thing-for example, 
What is clay?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and we were to reply, that there is a clay of potters, 
there is a clay</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of oven-makers, there is a clay of brick-makers; would 
not the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">answer be ridiculous?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Truly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. In the first place, there would be an absurdity 
in assuming</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that he who asked the question would understand from our 
answer the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">nature of &quot;clay,&quot; merely because we added &quot;of the 
image-makers,&quot; or of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">any other workers. How can a man understand the name of 
anything, when</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he does not know the nature of it?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. He cannot.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then he who does not know what science or 
knowledge is, has</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">no knowledge of the art or science of making shoes?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. None.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Nor of any other science?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. No.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And when a man is asked what science or knowledge 
is, to give</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in answer the name of some art or science is ridiculous; 
for the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">-question is, &quot;What is knowledge?&quot; and he replies, &quot;A 
knowledge of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">this or that.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Moreover, he might answer shortly and simply, but 
he makes an</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">enormous circuit. For example, when asked about the day, 
he might have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">said simply, that clay is moistened earth-what sort of 
clay is not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to the point.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, Socrates, there is no difficulty as you 
put the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">question. You mean, if I am not mistaken, something like 
what occurred</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to me and to my friend here, your namesake Socrates, in 
a recent</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">discussion.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. What was that, Theaetetus?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Theodorus was writing out for us something 
about roots, such</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">as the roots of three or five, showing that they are 
incommensurable</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">by the unit: he selected other examples up to 
seventeen-there he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">stopped. Now as there are innumerable roots, the notion 
occurred to us</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of attempting to include them all under one name or 
class.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And did you find such a class?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I think that we did; but I should like to have 
your opinion.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Let me hear.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. We divided all numbers into two classes: those 
which are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">made up of equal factors multiplying into one another, 
which we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">compared to square figures and called square or 
equilateral</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">numbers;-that was one class.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Very good.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>148&nbsp;</b> Theaet. The intermediate numbers, such as 
three and five, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">every other number which is made up of unequal factors, 
either of a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">greater multiplied by a less, or of a less multiplied by 
a greater,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and when regarded as a figure, is contained in unequal 
sides;-all</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">these we compared to oblong figures, and called them 
oblong numbers.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Capital; and what followed?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. The lines, or sides, which have for their 
squares the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">equilateral plane numbers, were called by us lengths or 
magnitudes;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and the lines which are the roots of (or whose squares 
are equal to)</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the oblong numbers, were called powers or roots; the 
reason of this</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">latter name being, that they are commensurable with the 
former</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">[i.e., with the so-called lengths or magnitudes] not in 
linear</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">measurement, but in the value of the superficial content 
of their</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">squares; and the same about solids.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Excellent, my boys; I think that you fully 
justify the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">praises of Theodorus, and that he will not be found 
guilty of false</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">witness.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. But I am unable, Socrates, to give you a 
similar answer</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">about knowledge, which is what you appear to want; and 
therefore</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theodorus is a deceiver after all.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Well, but if some one were to praise you for 
running, and to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">say that he never met your equal among boys, and 
afterwards you were</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">beaten in a race by a grown-up man, who was a great 
runner-would the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">praise be any the less true?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And is the discovery of the nature of knowledge 
so small a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">matter, as just now said? Is it not one which would task 
the powers of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">men perfect in every way?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. By heaven, they should be the top of all 
perfection!</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp; Soc. Well, then, be of good cheer; do not say that 
Theodorus was</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">mistaken about you, but do your best to ascertain the 
true nature of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge, as well as of other things.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I am eager enough, Socrates, if that would 
bring to light</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the truth.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Come, you made a good beginning just now; let 
your own answer</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">about roots be your model, and as you comprehended them 
all in one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">class, try and bring the many sorts of knowledge under 
one definition.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I can assure you, Socrates, that I have tried 
very often,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">when the report of questions asked by you was brought to 
me; but I can</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">neither persuade myself that I have a satisfactory 
answer to give, nor</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">hear of any one who answers as you would have him; and I 
cannot</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">shake off a feeling of anxiety.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. These are the pangs of labour, my dear Theaetetus; 
you have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">something within you which you are bringing to the 
birth.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I do not know, Socrates; I only say what I 
feel.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>149</b>&nbsp; Soc. And have you never heard, simpleton, 
that I am the son of a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">midwife, brave and burly, whose name was Phaenarete?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, I have.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And that I myself practise midwifery?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. No, never.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Let me tell you that I do though, my friend: but 
you must not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">reveal the secret, as the world in general have not 
found me out;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and therefore they only say of me, that I am the 
strangest of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">mortals and drive men to their wits' end. Did you ever 
hear that too?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Shall I tell you the reason?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. By all means.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Bear in mind the whole business of the mid-wives, 
and then</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you will see my meaning better:-No woman, as you are 
probably aware,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">who is still able to conceive and bear, attends other 
women, but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">only those who are past bearing.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes; I know.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. The reason of this is said to be that Artemis-the 
goddess of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">childbirth-is not a mother, and she honours those who 
are like</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">herself; but she could not allow the barren to be 
mid-wives, because</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">human nature cannot know the mystery of an art without 
experience; and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">therefore she assigned this office to those who are too 
old to bear.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I dare say.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And I dare say too, or rather I am absolutely 
certain, that the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">mid-wives know better than others who is pregnant and 
who is not?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And by the use of potions and incantations they 
are able to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">arouse the pangs and to soothe them at will; they can 
make those</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">bear who have a difficulty in bearing, and if they think 
fit they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">can smother the embryo in the womb.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. They can.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Did you ever remark that they are also most 
cunning</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">matchmakers, and have a thorough knowledge of what 
unions are likely</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to produce a brave brood?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. No, never.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then let me tell you that this is their greatest 
pride, more</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">than cutting the umbilical cord. And if you reflect, you 
will see that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the same art which cultivates and gathers in the fruits 
of the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">earth, will be most likely to know in what soils the 
several plants or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">seeds should be deposited.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, the same art.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And do you suppose that with women the case is 
otherwise?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I should think not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>150</b>&nbsp; Soc. Certainly not; but mid-wives are 
respectable women who have a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">character to lose, and they avoid this department of 
their profession,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">because they are afraid of being called procuresses, 
which is a name</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">given to those who join together man and woman in an 
unlawful and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">unscientific way; and yet the true midwife is also the 
true and only</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">matchmaker.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Such are the mid-wives, whose task is a very 
important one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">but not so important as mine; for women do not bring 
into the world at</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one time real children, and at another time counterfeits 
which are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">with difficulty distinguished from them; if they did, 
then the,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">discernment of the true and false birth would be the 
crowning</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">achievement of the art of midwifery-you would think so?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Indeed I should.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Well, my art of midwifery is in most respects 
like theirs;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">but differs, in that I attend men and not women; and 
look after</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">their souls when they are in labour, and not after their 
bodies: and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the triumph of my art is in thoroughly examining whether 
the thought</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which the mind of the young man brings forth is a false 
idol or a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">noble and true birth. And like the mid-wives, I am 
barren, and the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">reproach which is often made against me, that I ask 
questions of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">others and have not the wit to answer them myself, is 
very just-the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">reason is, that the god compels-me to be a midwife, but 
does not allow</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">me to bring forth. And therefore I am not myself at all 
wise, nor have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I anything to show which is the invention or birth of my 
own soul, but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">those who converse with me profit. Some of them appear 
dull enough</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">at first, but afterwards, as our acquaintance ripens, if 
the god is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">gracious to them, they all make astonishing progress; 
and this in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the opinion of others as well as in their own. It is 
quite dear that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">they never learned anything from me; the many fine 
discoveries to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which they cling are of their own making. But to me and 
the god they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">owe their delivery. And the proof of my words is, that 
many of them in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">their ignorance, either in their self-conceit despising 
me, or falling</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">under the influence of others, have gone away too soon; 
and have not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">only lost the children of whom I had previously 
delivered them by an</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ill bringing up, but have stifled whatever else they had 
in them by</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">evil communications, being fonder of lies and shams than 
of the truth;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and they have at last ended by seeing themselves, as 
others see</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">them, to be great fools. Aristeides, the son of 
Lysimachus, is one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of them, and there are many others. The truants often 
return to me,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and beg that I would consort with them again-they are 
ready to go to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">me on their knees and then, if my familiar allows, which 
is not always</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the case, I receive them, and they begin to grow again. 
Dire are the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">pangs which my art is able to arouse and to allay in 
those who consort</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">with me, just like the pangs of women in childbirth; 
night and day</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">they are full of perplexity and travail which is even 
worse than</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that of the women. So much for them. And there are 
-others,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theaetetus, who come to me apparently having nothing in 
them; and as I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">know that they have no need of my art, I coax them into 
marrying</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">some one, and by the grace of God I can generally tell 
who is likely</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to do them good. Many of them I have given away to 
Prodicus, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">many to other inspired sages. I tell you this long 
story, friend</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theaetetus, because I suspect, as indeed you seem to 
think yourself,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that you are in labour-great with some conception. Come 
then to me,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">who am a midwife's son and myself a midwife, and do your 
best to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">answer the questions which I will ask you. And if I 
abstract and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">expose your first-born, because I discover upon 
inspection that the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">conception which you have formed is a vain shadow, do 
not quarrel with</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">me on that account, as the manner of women is when their 
first</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>151 </b>children are taken from them. For I have 
actually known some who</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">were ready to bite me when I deprived them of a darling 
folly; they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">did not perceive that I acted from good will, not 
knowing that no</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">god is the enemy of man-that was not within the range of 
their</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ideas; neither am I their enemy in all this, but it 
would be wrong for</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">me to admit falsehood, or to stifle the truth. Once 
more, then,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theaetetus, I repeat my old question, &quot;What is 
knowledge?&quot;-and do</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not say that you cannot tell; but quit yourself like a 
man, and by the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">help of God you will be able to tell.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. At any rate, Socrates, after such an 
exhortation I should be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ashamed of not trying to do my best. Now he who knows 
perceives what</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he knows, and, as far as I can see at present, knowledge 
is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perception.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Bravely said, boy; that is the way in which you 
should</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">express your opinion. And now, let us examine together 
this conception</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of yours, and see whether it is a true birth or a mere,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wind-egg:-You say that knowledge is perception?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>152</b>&nbsp; Soc. Well, you have delivered yourself of a 
very important</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">doctrine about knowledge; it is indeed the opinion of 
Protagoras,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">who has another way of expressing it, Man, he says, is 
the measure</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of all things, of the existence of things that are, and 
of the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">non-existence of things that are not:-You have read him?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. O yes, again and again.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Does he not say that things are to you such as 
they appear to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you, and to me such as they appear to me, and that you 
and I are men?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, he says so.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. A wise man is not likely to talk nonsense. Let us 
try to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">understand him: the same wind is blowing, and yet one of 
us may be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">cold and the other not, or one may be slightly and the 
other very</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">cold?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Quite true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Now is the wind, regarded not in relation to us 
but absolutely,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">cold or not; or are we to say, with Protagoras, that the 
wind is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">cold to him who is cold, and not to him who is not?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I suppose the last.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then it must appear so to each of them?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And &quot;appears to him&quot; means the same as &quot;he 
perceives.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then appearing and perceiving coincide in the 
case of hot and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">cold, and in similar instances; for things appear, or 
may be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">supposed to be, to each one such as he perceives them?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then perception is always of existence, and being 
the same as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge is unerring?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. In the name of the Graces, what an almighty wise 
man Protagoras</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">must have been! He spoke these things in a parable to 
the common herd,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">like you and me, but told the truth, his Truth, in 
secret to his own</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">disciples.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What do you mean, Socrates?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I am about to speak of a high argument, in which 
all things are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">said to be relative; you cannot rightly call anything by 
any name,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">such as great or small, heavy or light, for the great 
will be small</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and the heavy light-there is no single thing or quality, 
but out of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">motion and change and admixture all things are becoming 
relatively</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to one another, which &quot;becoming&quot; is by us incorrectly 
called being,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">but is really becoming, for nothing ever is, but all 
things are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">becoming. Summon all philosophers-Protagoras, 
Heracleitus, Empedocles,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and the rest of them, one after another, and with the 
exception of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Parmenides they will agree with you in this. Summon the 
great</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">masters of either kind of poetry-Epicharmus, the prince 
of Comedy, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Homer of Tragedy; when the latter sings of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ocean whence sprang the gods, and mother Tethys,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">does he not mean that all things are the offspring, of 
flux and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">motion?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I think so.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>153&nbsp;</b> Soc. And who could take up arms against such 
a great army having</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Homer for its general, and not appear ridiculous?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Who indeed, Socrates?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Yes, Theaetetus; and there are plenty of other 
proofs which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">will show that motion is the source of what is called 
being and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">becoming, and inactivity of not-being and destruction; 
for fire and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">warmth, which are supposed to be the parent and guardian 
of all</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">other things, are born of movement and friction, which 
is a kind of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">motion;-is not this the origin of fire?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. It is.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And the race of animals is generated in the same 
way?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And is not the bodily habit spoiled by rest and 
idleness, but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">preserved for a long time by motion and exercise?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And what of the mental habit? Is not the soul 
informed, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">improved, and preserved by study and attention, which 
are motions; but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">when at rest, which in the soul only means want of 
attention and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">study, is uninformed, and speedily forgets whatever she 
has learned?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then motion is a good, and rest an evil, to the 
soul as well as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to the body?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I may add, that breathless calm, stillness and 
the like waste</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and impair, while wind and storm preserve; and the 
palmary argument of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">all, which I strongly urge, is the golden chain in 
Homer, by which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he means the sun, thereby indicating that so long as the 
sun and the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">heavens go round in their orbits, all things human and 
divine are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and are preserved, but if they were chained up and their 
motions</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ceased, then all things would be destroyed, and, as the 
saying is,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">turned upside down.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I believe, Socrates, that you have truly 
explained his</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">meaning.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then now apply his doctrine to perception, my 
good friend,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and first of all to vision; that which you call white 
colour is not in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">your eyes, and is not a distinct thing which exists out 
of them. And</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you must not assign any place to it: for if it had 
position it would</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be, and be at rest, and there would be no process of 
becoming.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Then what is colour?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Let us carry the principle which has just been 
affirmed, that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">nothing is self-existent, and then we shall see that 
white, black, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">every other colour, arises out of the eye meeting the 
appropriate</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">motion, and that what we call a colour is in each case 
neither the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">active nor the passive element, but something which 
passes between</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>154 </b>them, and is peculiar to each percipient; are 
you quite certain that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the several colours appear to a dog or to any animal 
whatever as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">they appear to you?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Far from it.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Or that anything appears the same to you as to 
another man? Are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you so profoundly convinced of this? Rather would it not 
be true</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that it never appears exactly the same to you, because 
you are never</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">exactly the same?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. The latter.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And if that with which I compare myself in size, 
or which I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">apprehend by touch, were great or white or hot, it could 
not become</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">different by mere contact with another unless it 
actually changed; nor</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">again, if the comparing or apprehending subject were 
great or white or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">hot, could this, when unchanged from within become 
changed by any</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">approximation or affection of any other thing. The fact 
is that in our</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ordinary way of speaking we allow ourselves to be driven 
into most</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ridiculous and wonderful contradictions, as Protagoras 
and all who</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">take his line of argument would remark.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. How? and of what sort do you mean?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. A little instance will sufficiently explain my 
meaning: Here</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are six dice, which are more by a half when compared 
with four, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">fewer by a half than twelve-they are more and also 
fewer. How can</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you or any one maintain the contrary?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Well, then, suppose that Protagoras or some one 
asks whether</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">anything can become greater or more if not by 
increasing, how would</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you answer him, Theaetetus?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I should say &quot;No,&quot; Socrates, if I were to 
speak my mind in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">reference to this last question, and if I were not 
afraid of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">contradicting my former answer.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Capital excellent! spoken like an oracle, my boy! 
And if you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">reply &quot;Yes,&quot; there will be a case for Euripides; for our 
tongue will</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be unconvinced, but not our mind.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. The thoroughbred Sophists, who know all that can 
be known about</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the mind, and argue only out of the superfluity of their 
wits, would</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have had a regular sparring-match over this, and would 
-have knocked</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">their arguments together finely. But you and I, who have 
no</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">professional aims, only desire to see what is the mutual 
relation of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">these principles-whether they are consistent with each 
or not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, that would be my desire.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>155</b>&nbsp; Soc. And mine too. But since this is our 
feeling, and there is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">plenty of time, why should we not calmly and patiently 
review our</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">own thoughts, and thoroughly examine and see what these 
appearances in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">us really are? If I am not mistaken, they will be 
described by us as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">follows:-first, that nothing can become greater or less, 
either in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">number or magnitude, while remaining equal to itself-you 
would agree?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Secondly, that without addition or subtraction 
there is no</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">increase or diminution of anything, but only equality.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Quite true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Thirdly, that what was not before cannot be 
afterwards, without</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">becoming and having become.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, truly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. These three axioms, if I am not mistaken, are 
fighting with one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">another in our minds in the case of the dice, or, again, 
in such a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">case as this-if I were to say that I, who am of a 
certain height and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">taller than you, may within a year, without gaining or 
losing in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">height, be not so tall-not that I should have lost, but 
that you would</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have increased. In such a case, I am afterwards what I 
once was not,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and yet I have not become; for I could not have become 
without</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">becoming, neither could I have become less without 
losing somewhat</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of my height; and I could give you ten thousand examples 
of similar</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">contradictions, if we admit them at all. I believe that 
you follow me,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theaetetus; for I suspect that you have thought of these 
questions</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">before now.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, Socrates, and I am amazed when I think of 
them; by</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the Gods I am! and I want to know what on earth they 
mean; and there</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are times when my head quite swims with the 
contemplation of them.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I see, my dear Theaetetus, that Theodorus had a 
true insight</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">into your nature when he said that you were a 
philosopher, for</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wonder is the feeling of a philosopher, and philosophy 
begins in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wonder. He was not a bad genealogist who said that Iris 
(the messenger</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of heaven) is the child of Thaumas (wonder). But do you 
begin to see</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">what is the explanation of this perplexity on the 
hypothesis which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">we attribute to Protagoras?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Not as yet.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;Soc. Then you will be obliged to me if I help you to 
unearth the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">hidden &quot;truth&quot; of a famous man or school.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. To be sure, I shall be very much obliged.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Take a look round, then, and see that none of the 
uninitiated</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are listening. Now by the uninitiated I mean: the people 
who believe</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in nothing but what they can grasp in their hands, and 
who will not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">allow that action or generation or anything invisible 
can have real</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">existence.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>156</b>&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, indeed, Socrates, they are very 
hard and impenetrable</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">mortals.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Yes, my boy, outer barbarians. Far more ingenious 
are the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">brethren whose mysteries I am about to reveal to you. 
Their first</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">principle is, that all is motion, and upon this all the 
affections</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of which we were just now speaking, are supposed to 
depend: there is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">nothing but motion, which has two forms, one active and 
the other</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">passive, both in endless number; and out of the union 
and friction</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of them there is generated a progeny endless in number, 
having two</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">forms, sense and the object of sense, which are ever 
breaking forth</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and coming to the birth at the same moment. The senses 
are variously</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">named hearing, seeing, smelling; there is the sense of 
heat, cold,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">pleasure, pain, desire, fear, and many more which have 
names, as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">well as innumerable others which are without them; each 
has its</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">kindred object each variety of colour has a 
corresponding variety of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sight, and so with sound and hearing, and with the rest 
of the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">senses and the objects akin to them. Do you see, 
Theaetetus, the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">bearings of this tale on the preceding argument?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Indeed I do not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then attend, and I will try to finish the story. 
The purport is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that all these things are in motion, as I was saying, 
and that this</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">motion is of two kinds, a slower and a quicker; and the 
slower</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">elements have their motions in the same place and with 
reference to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">things near them, and so they beget; but what is 
begotten is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">swifter, for it is carried to fro, and moves from place 
to place.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Apply this to sense:-When the eye and the appropriate 
object meet</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">together and give birth to whiteness and the sensation 
connatural with</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">it, which could not have been given by either of them 
going elsewhere,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">then, while the sight: is flowing from the eye, 
whiteness proceeds</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">from the object which combines in producing the colour; 
and so the eye</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is fulfilled with sight, and really sees, and becomes, 
not sight,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">but a seeing eye; and the object which combined to form 
the colour</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is fulfilled with whiteness, and becomes not whiteness 
but a white</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thing, whether wood or stone or whatever the object may 
be which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">happens to be colour,ed white. And this is true of all 
sensible</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">objects, hard, warm, and the like, which are similarly 
to be regarded,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>157 </b>as I was saying before, not as having any 
absolute existence, but as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">being all of them of whatever kind. generated by motion 
in their</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">intercourse with one another; for of the agent and 
patient, as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">existing in separation, no trustworthy conception, as 
they say, can be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">formed, for the agent has no existence until united; 
with the patient,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and the patient has no existence until united with the 
agent; and that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which by uniting with something becomes an agent, by 
meeting with some</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">other thing is converted into a patient. And from all 
these</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">considerations, as I said at first, there arises a 
general reflection,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that there is no one self-existent thing, but everything 
is becoming</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and in relation; and being must be altogether abolished, 
although from</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">habit and ignorance we are compelled even in this 
discussion to retain</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the use of the term. But great philosophers tell us that 
we are not to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">allow either the word &quot;something,&quot; or &quot;belonging to 
something,&quot; or &quot;to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">me,&quot; or &quot;this,&quot; or &quot;that,&quot; or any other detaining name 
to be used,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in the language of nature all things are being created 
and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">destroyed, coming into being and passing into new forms; 
nor can any</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">name fix or detain them; he who attempts to fix them is 
easily</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">refuted. And this should be the way of speaking, not 
only of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">particulars but of aggregates such aggregates as are 
expressed in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the word &quot;man,&quot; or &quot;stone,&quot; or any name of animal or of 
a class. O</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theaetetus, are not these speculations sweet as honey? 
And do you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not like the taste of them in the mouth?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I do not know what to say, Socrates, for, 
indeed, I cannot</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">make out whether you are giving your own opinion or only 
wanting to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">draw me out.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. You forget, my friend, that I neither know, nor 
profess to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">know, anything of! these matters; you are the person who 
is in labour,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I am the barren midwife; and this is why I soothe you, 
and offer you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one good thing after another, that you may taste them. 
And I hope that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I may at last help to bring your own opinion into the 
light of day:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">when this has been accomplished, then we will determine 
whether what</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you have brought forth is only a wind-egg or a real and 
genuine birth.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Therefore, keep up your spirits, and answer like a man 
what you think.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Ask me.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then once more: Is it your opinion that nothing 
is but what</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">becomes? the good and the noble, as well; as all the 
other things</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which we were just now mentioning?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. When I hear you discoursing in this style, I 
think that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">there is a great deal in what you say, and I am very 
ready to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">assent. Soc. Let us not leave the argument unfinished, 
then; for there</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">still remains to be considered an objection which may be 
raised</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">about dreams and diseases, in particular about madness, 
and the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">various illusions of hearing and sight, or of other 
senses. For you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>158</b> know that in all these cases the esse-percipi 
theory appears to be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">unmistakably refuted, since in dreams and illusions we 
certainly</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have false perceptions; and far from saying that 
everything is which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">appears, we should rather say that nothing is which 
appears.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very true, Socrates.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But then, my boy, how can any one contend that 
knowledge is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perception, or that to every man what appears is?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I am afraid to say, Socrates, that I have 
nothing to answer,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">because you rebuked me just now for making this excuse; 
but I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">certainly cannot undertake to argue that madmen or 
dreamers think</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">truly, when they imagine, some of them that they are 
gods, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">others that they can fly, and are flying in their sleep.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Do you see another question which can be raised 
about these</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">phenomena, notably about dreaming and waking?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What question?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. A question which I think that you must often have 
heard persons</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ask:-How can you determine whether at this moment we are 
sleeping, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">all our thoughts are a dream; or whether we are awake, 
and talking</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to one another in the waking state?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Indeed, Socrates, I do not know how to prove 
the one any</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">more than the other, for in both cases the facts 
precisely</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">correspond;-and there is no difficulty in supposing that 
during all</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">this discussion we have been talking to one another in a 
dream; and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">when in a dream we seem to be narrating dreams, the 
resemblance of the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">two states is quite astonishing.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. You see, then, that a doubt about the reality of 
sense is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">easily raised, since there may even be a doubt whether 
we are awake or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in a dream. And as our time is equally divided between 
sleeping and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">waking, in either sphere of existence the soul contends 
that the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thoughts which are present to our minds at the time are 
true; and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">during one half of our lives we affirm the truth of the 
one, and,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">during the other half, of the other; and are equally 
confident of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">both.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Most true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And may not the same be said of madness and other 
disorders?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the difference is only that the times are not equal.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And is truth or falsehood to be determined by 
duration of time?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. That would be in many ways ridiculous.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But can you certainly determine: by any other 
means which of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">these opinions is true?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I do not think that I can.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Listen, then to a statement of the other side of 
the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">argument, which is made by the champions of appearance. 
They would</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">say, as I imagine-can that which is wholly other than 
something,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have the same quality as that from which it differs? and 
observe,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">-Theaetetus, that the word &quot;other&quot; means not 
&quot;partially,&quot; but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&quot;wholly other.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>159</b>&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly, putting the question as 
you do, that which is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wholly other cannot either potentially or in any other 
way be the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">same.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And must therefore be admitted to be unlike?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. If, then, anything happens to become like or 
unlike itself or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">another, when it becomes like we call it the same-when 
unlike, other?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Were we not saying that there. are agents many 
and infinite,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and patients many and infinite?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And also that different combinations will produce 
results which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are not the same, but different?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Let us take you and me, or anything as an 
example:-There is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Socrates in health, and Socrates sick-Are they like or 
unlike?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. You mean to, compare Socrates in health as a 
whole, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Socrates in sickness as a whole?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Exactly; that is my meaning.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I answer, they are unlike.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And if unlike, they are other?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And would you not say the same of Socrates 
sleeping and waking,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">or in any of the states which we were mentioning?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I should.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. All agents have a different patient in Socrates, 
accordingly as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he is well or ill.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Of course.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And I who am the patient, and that which is the 
agent, will</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">produce something different in each of the two cases?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. The wine which I drink when I am in health, 
appears sweet and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">pleasant to me?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. For, as has been already acknowledged, the 
patient and agent</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">meet together and produce sweetness and a perception of 
sweetness,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which are in simultaneous motion, and the perception 
which comes</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">from the patient makes the tongue percipient, and the 
quality of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sweetness which arises out of and is moving about the 
wine, makes</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the wine, both to be and to appear sweet to the healthy 
tongue.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly; that has been already acknowledged.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But when I am sick, the wine really acts upon 
another and a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">different person?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. The combination of the draught of wine, and the 
Socrates who is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sick, produces quite another result; which is the 
sensation of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">bitterness in the tongue, and the, motion and creation 
of bitterness</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in and about the wine, which becomes not bitterness but 
something</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">bitter; as I myself become not but percipient?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>160</b>&nbsp; Soc. There is no, other object of which I 
shall ever have the same</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perception, for another object would give another 
perception, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">would make the perception other and different; nor can 
that object</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which affects me, meeting another, subject, produce, the 
same, or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">become similar, for that too would produce another 
result from another</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">subject, and become different.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Neither can by myself, have this sensation, nor 
the object by</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">itself, this quality.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. When I perceive I must become percipient of 
something-there can</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be no such thing as perceiving and perceiving nothing; 
the object,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">whether it become sweet, bitter, or of any other 
quality, must have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">relation to a percipient; nothing can become sweet which 
is sweet to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">no one.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then the inference is, that we [the agent and 
patient] are or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">become in relation to one another; there is a law which 
binds us one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to the other, but not to any other existence, nor each 
of us to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">himself; and therefore we can only be bound to one 
another; so that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">whether a person says that a thing is or becomes, he 
must say that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">it is or becomes to or of or in relation to something 
else; but he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">must not say or allow any one else to say that anything 
is or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">becomes absolutely: -such is our conclusion.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very true, Socrates.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then, if that which acts upon me has relation to 
me and to no</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">other, I and no other am the percipient of it?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Of course.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then my perception is true to me, being 
inseparable from my own</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">being; and, as Protagoras says, to myself I am judge of 
what is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and-what is not to me.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I suppose so.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. How then, if I never err, and if my mind never 
trips in the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">conception of being or becoming, can I fail of knowing 
that which I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perceive?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. You cannot.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then you were quite right in affirming that 
knowledge is only</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perception; and the meaning turns out to be the same, 
whether with</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Homer and Heracleitus, and all that company, you say 
that all is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">motion and flux, or with the great sage Protagoras, that 
man is the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">measure of all things; or with Theaetetus, that, given 
these premises,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perception is knowledge. Am I not right, Theaetetus, and 
is not this</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">your newborn child, of which I have delivered you? What 
say you?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I cannot but agree, Socrates.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>161&nbsp;</b> Soc. Then this is the child, however he may 
turn out, which you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and I have with difficulty brought into the world. And 
now that he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is born, we must run round the hearth with him, and see 
whether he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is worth rearing, or is only a wind-egg and a sham. Is 
he to be reared</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in any case, and not exposed? or will you bear to see 
him rejected,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and not get into a passion if I take away your 
first-born?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Theaetetus will not be angry, for he is very 
good-natured.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">But tell me, Socrates, in heaven's name, is this, after 
all, not the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">truth?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. You, Theodorus, are a lover of theories, and now 
you innocently</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">fancy that I am a bag full of them, and can easily pull 
one out</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which will overthrow its predecessor. But you do not see 
that in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">reality none of these theories come from me; they all 
come from him</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">who talks with me. I only know just enough to extract 
them from the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wisdom of another, and to receive them in a spirit of 
fairness. And</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">now I shall say nothing myself, but shall endeavour to 
elicit</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">something from our young friend.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Do as you say, Socrates; you are quite right.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Shall I tell you, Theodorus, what amazes me in 
your</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">acquaintance Protagoras?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. What is it?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I am charmed with his doctrine, that what appears 
is to each</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one, but I wonder that he did not begin his book on 
Truth with a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">declaration that a pig or a dog-faced baboon, or some 
other yet</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">stranger monster which has sensation, is the measure of 
all things;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">then he might have shown a magnificent contempt for our 
opinion of him</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">by informing us at the outset that while we were 
reverencing him</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">like a God for his wisdom he was no better than a 
tadpole, not to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">speak of his fellow-men-would not this have produced an</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">over-powering effect? For if truth is only sensation, 
and no man can</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">discern another's feelings better than he, or has any 
superior right</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to determine whether his opinion is true or false, but 
each, as we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have several times repeated, is to himself the sole 
judge, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">everything that he judges is true and right, why, my 
friend, should</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Protagoras be preferred to the place of wisdom and 
instruction, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">deserve to be well paid, and we poor ignoramuses have to 
go to him, if</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">each one is the measure of his own wisdom? Must he not 
be talking ad</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">captandum in all this? I say nothing of the ridiculous 
predicament</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in which my own midwifery and the whole art of dialectic 
is placed;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">for the attempt to supervise or refute the notions or 
opinions of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">others would be a tedious and enormous piece of folly, 
if to each</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">man his own are right; and this must be the case if 
Protagoras Truth</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is the real truth, and the philosopher is not merely 
amusing himself</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">by giving oracles out of the shrine of his book.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>162</b>&nbsp; Theod. He was a friend of mine, Socrates, as 
you were saying, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">therefore I cannot have him refuted by my lips, nor can 
I oppose you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">when I agree with you; please, then, to take Theaetetus 
again; he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">seemed to answer very nicely.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. If you were to go into a Lacedaemonian palestra, 
Theodorus,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">would you have a right to look on at the naked 
wrestlers, some of them</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">making a poor figure, if you did not strip and give them 
an</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opportunity of judging of your own person?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Why not, Socrates, if they would allow me, as I 
think you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">will in consideration of my age and stiffness; let some 
more supple</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">youth try a fall with you, and do not drag me into the 
gymnasium.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Your will is my will, Theodorus, as the 
proverbial philosophers</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">say, and therefore I will return to the sage Theaetetus: 
Tell me,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theaetetus, in reference to what I was saying, are you 
not lost in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wonder, like myself, when you find that all of a sudden 
you are raised</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to the level of the wisest of men, or indeed of the 
gods?-for you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">would assume the measure of Protagoras to apply to the 
gods as well as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">men?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly I should, and I confess to you that 
I am lost in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wonder. At first hearing, I was quite satisfied with the 
doctrine,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that whatever appears is to each one, but now the face 
of things has</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">changed.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Why, my dear boy, you are young, and therefore 
your ear is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">quickly caught and your mind influenced by popular 
arguments.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Protagoras, or some one speaking on his behalf, will 
doubtless say</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in reply, good people, young and old, you meet and 
harangue, and bring</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in the gods, whose existence of non-existence I banish 
from writing</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and speech, or you talk about the reason of man being 
degraded to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the level of the brutes, which is a telling argument 
with the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">multitude, but not one word of proof or demonstration do 
you offer.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">All is probability with you, and yet surely you and 
Theodorus had</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">better reflect whether you are disposed to admit of 
probability and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">figures of speech in matters of such importance. He or 
any other</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">mathematician who argued from probabilities and 
likelihoods in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">geometry, would not be worth an ace.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. But neither you nor we, Socrates, would be 
satisfied with</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">such arguments.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>163</b>&nbsp; Soc. Then you and Theodorus mean to say that 
we must look at the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">matter in some other way?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, in quite another way.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And the way will be to ask whether perception is 
or is not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the same as knowledge; for this was the real point of 
our argument,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and with a view to this we raised (did we not?) those 
many strange</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">questions.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Shall we say that we know every thing which we 
see and hear?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">for example, shall we say that not having learned, we do 
not hear</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the language of foreigners when they speak to us? or 
shall we say that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">we not only hear, but know what they are saying? Or 
again, if we see</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">letters which we do not understand, shall we say that we 
do not see</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">them? or shall we aver that, seeing them, we must know 
them?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. We shall say, Socrates, that we know what we 
actually see</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and hear of them-that is to say, we see and know the 
figure and colour</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of the letters, and we hear and know the elevation or 
depression of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the sound of them; but we do not perceive by sight and 
hearing, or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">know, that which grammarians and interpreters teach 
about them.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Capital, Theaetetus; and about this there shall 
be no</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">dispute, because I want you to grow; but there is 
another difficulty</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">coming, which you will also have to repulse.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What is it?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Some one will say, Can a man who has ever known 
anything, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">still has and preserves a memory of that which he knows, 
not know that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which he remembers at the time when he remembers? I 
have, I fear, a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">tedious way of putting a simple question, which is only, 
whether a man</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">who has learned, and remembers, can fail to know?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Impossible, Socrates; the supposition is 
monstrous.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Am I talking nonsense, then? Think: is not seeing 
perceiving,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and is not sight perception?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And if our recent definition holds, every man 
knows that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which he has seen?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And you would admit that there is such a thing as 
memory?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And is memory of something or of nothing?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Of something, surely.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Of things learned and perceived, that is?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Often a man remembers that which he has seen?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And if he closed his eyes, would he forget?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Who, Socrates, would dare to say so?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>164</b>&nbsp; Soc. But we must say so, if the previous 
argument is to be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">maintained.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What do you mean? I am not quite sure that I 
understand you,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">though I have a strong suspicion that you are right.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. As thus: he who sees knows, as we say, that which 
he sees;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">for perception and sight and knowledge are admitted to 
be the same.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But he who saw, and has knowledge of that which 
he saw,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">remembers, when he closes his eyes, that which he no 
longer sees.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And seeing is knowing, and therefore not-seeing 
is not-knowing?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then the inference is, that a man may have 
attained the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge, of something, which he may remember and yet 
not know,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">because he does not see; and this has been affirmed by 
us to be a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">monstrous supposition.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Most true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Thus, then, the assertion that knowledge and 
perception are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one, involves a manifest impossibility?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then they must be distinguished?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I suppose that they must.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Once more we shall have to begin, and ask &quot;What 
is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge?&quot; and yet, Theaetetus, what are we going to 
do?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. About what?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Like a good-for-nothing cock, without having won 
the victory,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">we walk away from the argument and crow.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. How do you mean?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. After the manner of disputers, we were satisfied 
with mere</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">verbal consistency, and were well pleased if in this way 
we could gain</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">an advantage. Although professing not to be mere 
Eristics, but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">philosophers, I suspect that we have unconsciously 
fallen into the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">error of that ingenious class of persons.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I do not as yet understand you.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then I will try to explain myself: just now we 
asked the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">question, whether a man who had learned and remembered 
could fail to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">know, and we showed that a person who had seen might 
remember when</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he had his eyes shut and could not see, and then he 
would at the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">same time remember and not know. But this was an 
impossibility. And so</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the Protagorean fable came to nought, and yours also, 
who maintained</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that knowledge is the same as perception.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And yet, my friend, I rather suspect that the 
result would have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">been different if Protagoras, who was the father of the 
first of the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">two-brats, had been alive; he would have had a great 
deal to say on</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">their behalf. But he is dead, and we insult over his 
orphan child; and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">even the guardians whom he left, and of whom our friend 
Theodorus is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one, are unwilling to give any help, and therefore I 
suppose that must</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">take up his cause myself, and see justice done?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>165&nbsp;</b> Theod. Not I, Socrates, but rather Callias, 
the son of Hipponicus,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is guardian of his orphans. I was too soon diverted from 
the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">abstractions of dialectic to geometry. Nevertheless, I 
shall be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">grateful to you if you assist him.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Very good, Theodorus; you shall see how I will 
come to the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">rescue. If a person does not attend to the meaning of 
terms as they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are commonly used in argument, he may be involved even 
in greater</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">paradoxes than these. Shall I explain this matter to you 
or to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theaetetus?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. To both of us, and let the younger answer; he 
will incur less</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">disgrace if he is discomfited.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then now let me ask the awful question, which is 
this:-Can a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">man know and also not know that which he knows?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. How shall we answer, Theaetetus?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. He cannot, I should say.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. He can, if you maintain that seeing is knowing. 
When you are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">imprisoned in a well, as the saying is, and the 
self-assured adversary</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">closes one of your eyes with his hand, and asks whether 
you can see</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">his cloak with the eye which he has closed, how will you 
answer the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">inevitable man?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I should answer, &quot;Not with that eye but with 
the other.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then you see and do not see the same thing at the 
same time.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, in a certain sense.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. None of that, he will reply; I do not ask or bid 
you answer</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in what sense you know, but only whether you know that 
which you do</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not know. You have been proved to see that which you do 
not see; and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you have already admitted that seeing is knowing, and 
that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not-seeing is not-knowing: I leave you to draw the 
inference.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, the inference is the contradictory of my 
assertion.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Yes, my marvel, and there might have been yet 
worse things in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">store for you, if an opponent had gone on to ask whether 
you can</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have a sharp and also a dull knowledge, and whether you 
can know near,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">but not at a distance, or know the same thing with more 
or less</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">intensity, and so on without end. Such questions might 
have been put</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to you by a light-armed mercenary, who argued for pay. 
He would have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">lain in wait for you, and when you took up the position, 
that sense is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge, he would have made an assault upon hearing, 
smelling, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the other senses;-he would have shown you no mercy; and 
while you were</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">lost in envy and admiration of his wisdom, he would have 
got you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">into his net, out of which you would not have escaped 
until you had</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">come to an understanding about the sum to be paid for 
your release.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Well, you ask, and how will Protagoras reinforce his 
position? Shall I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">answer for him?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. By all means.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>166&nbsp;</b> Soc. He will repeat all those things which 
we have been urging on</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">his behalf, and then he will close with us in disdain, 
and say:-The</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">worthy Socrates asked a little boy, whether the same man 
could</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">remember and not know the same thing, and the boy said 
No, because</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he was frightened, and could not see what was coming, 
and then</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Socrates made fun of poor me. The truth is, O slatternly 
Socrates,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that when you ask questions about any assertion of mine, 
and the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">person asked is found tripping, if he has answered as I 
should have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">answered, then I am refuted, but if he answers something 
else, then he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is refuted and not I. For do you really suppose that any 
one would</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">admit the memory which a man has of an impression which 
has passed</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">away to be the same with that which he experienced at 
the time?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Assuredly not. Or would he hesitate to acknowledge that 
the same man</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">may know and not know the same thing? Or, if he is 
afraid of making</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">this admission, would he ever grant that one who has 
become unlike</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is the same as before he became unlike? Or would he 
admit that a man</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is one at all, and not rather many and infinite as the 
changes which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">take place in him? I speak by the card in order to avoid 
entanglements</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of words. But, O my good sir, he would say, come to the 
argument in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">a more generous spirit; and either show, if you can, 
that our</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sensations are not relative and individual, or, if you 
admit them to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be so, prove that this does not involve the consequence 
that the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">appearance becomes, or, if you will have the word, is, 
to the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">individual only. As to your talk about pigs and baboons, 
you are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">yourself behaving like a pig, and you teach your hearers 
to make sport</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of my writings in the same ignorant manner; but this is 
not to your</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">credit. For I declare that the truth is as I have 
written, and that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">each of us is a measure of existence and of 
non-existence. Yet one man</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">may be a thousand times better than another in 
proportion as different</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">things are and appear to him.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; And I am far from saying that wisdom and the wise man 
have no</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">existence; but I say that the wise man is he who makes 
the evils which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">appear and are to a man, into goods which are and appear 
to him. And I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">would beg you not to my words in the letter, but to take 
the meaning</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of them as I will explain them. Remember what has been 
already</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">said,-that to the sick man his food appears to be and is 
bitter, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to the man in health the opposite of bitter. Now I 
cannot conceive</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that one of these men can be or ought to be made wiser 
than the other:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">nor can you assert that the sick man because he has one 
impression</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is foolish, and the healthy man because he has another 
is wise; but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the one state requires to be changed into the other, the 
worse into</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the better. As in education, a change of state has to be 
effected, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the sophist accomplishes by words the change which the 
physician works</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>167 </b>by the aid of drugs. Not that any one ever 
made another think truly,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">who previously thought falsely. For no one can think 
what is not, or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">think anything different from that which he feels; and 
this is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">always true. But as the inferior habit of mind has 
thoughts of kindred</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">nature, so I conceive that a good mind causes men to 
have good</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thoughts; and these which the inexperienced call true, I 
maintain to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be only better, and not truer than others. And, O my 
dear Socrates,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I do not call wise men tadpoles: far from it; I say that 
they are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the physicians of the human body, and the husbandmen of 
plants-for the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">husbandmen also take away the evil and disordered 
sensations of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">plants, and infuse into them good and healthy 
sensations-aye and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">true ones; and the wise and good rhetoricians make the 
good instead of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the evil to seem just to states; for whatever appears to 
a state to be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">just and fair, so long as it is regarded as such, is 
just and fair</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to it; but the teacher of wisdom causes the good to take 
the place</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of the evil, both in appearance and in reality. And in 
like manner the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Sophist who is able to train his pupils in this spirit 
is a wise</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">man, and deserves to be well paid by them. And so one 
man is wiser</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">than another; and no one thinks falsely, and you, 
whether you will</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">or not, must endure to be a measure. On these 
foundations the argument</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">stands firm, which you, Socrates, may, if you please, 
overthrow by</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">an opposite argument, or if you like you may put 
questions to me-a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">method to which no intelligent person will object, quite 
the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">reverse. But I must beg you to put fair questions: for 
there is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">great inconsistency in saying that you have a zeal for 
virtue, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">then always behaving unfairly in argument. The 
unfairness of which I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">complain is that you do not distinguish between mere 
disputation and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">dialectic: the disputer may trip up his opponent as 
often as he likes,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and make fun; but the dialectician will be in earnest, 
and only</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">correct his adversary when necessary, telling him the 
errors into</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which he has fallen through his own fault, or that of 
the company</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>168 </b>which he has previously kept. If you do so, 
your adversary will lay</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the blame of his own confusion and perplexity on 
himself, and not on</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you; will follow and love you, and will hate himself, 
and escape</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">from himself into philosophy, in order that he may 
become different</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">from what he was. But the other mode of arguing, which 
is practised by</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the many, will have just the opposite effect upon him; 
and as he grows</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">older, instead of turning philosopher, he will come to 
hate</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">philosophy. I would recommend you, therefore, as I said 
before, not to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">encourage yourself in this polemical and controversial 
temper, but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to find out, in a friendly and congenial spirit, what we 
really mean</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">when we say that all things are in motion, and that to 
every</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">individual and state what appears, is. In this manner 
you will</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">consider whether knowledge and sensation are the same or 
different,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">but you will not argue, as you were just now doing, from 
the customary</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">use of names and words, which the vulgar pervert in all 
sorts of ways,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">causing infinite perplexity to one another. Such, 
Theodorus, is the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">very slight help which I am able to offer to your old 
friend; had he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">been living, he would have helped himself in a far more 
gloriose</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">style.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. You are jesting, Socrates; indeed, your defence 
of him has</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">been most valorous.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Thank you, friend; and I hope that you observed 
Protagoras</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">bidding us be serious, as the text, &quot;Man is the measure 
of all</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">things,&quot; was a solemn one; and he reproached us with 
making a boy</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the medium of discourse, and said that the boy's 
timidity was made</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to tell against his argument; he also declared that we 
made a joke</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of him.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. How could I fail to observe all that, Socrates?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Well, and shall we do as he says?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. By all means.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But if his wishes are to be regarded, you and I 
must take up</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the argument, and in all seriousness, and ask and answer 
one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">another, for you see that the rest of us are nothing but 
boys. In no</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">other way can we escape the imputation, that in our 
fresh analysis</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of his thesis we are making fun with boys.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Well, but is not Theaetetus better able to 
follow a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">philosophical enquiry than a great many men who have 
long beards?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>169&nbsp;</b> Soc. Yes, Theodorus, but not better than 
you; and therefore please</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not to imagine that I am to defend by every means in my 
power your</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">departed friend; and that you are to defend nothing and 
nobody. At any</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">rate, my good man, do not sheer off until we know 
whether you are a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">true measure of diagrams, or whether all men are equally 
measures</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and sufficient for themselves in astronomy and geometry, 
and the other</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">branches of knowledge in which you are supposed to excel 
them.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. He who is sitting by you, Socrates, will not 
easily avoid</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">being drawn into an argument; and when I said just now 
that you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">would excuse me, and not, like the Lacedaemonians, 
compel me to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">strip and fight, I was talking nonsense-I should rather 
compare you to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Scirrhon, who threw travellers from the rocks; for the 
Lacedaemonian</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">rule is &quot;strip or depart,&quot; but you seem to go about your 
work more</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">after the fashion of Antaeus: you will not allow any one 
who</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">approaches you to depart until you have stripped him, 
and he has</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">been compelled to try a fall with you in argument.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. There, Theodorus, you have hit off precisely the 
nature of my</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">complaint; but I am even more pugnacious than the giants 
of old, for I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have met with no end of heroes; many a Heracles, many a 
Theseus,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">mighty in words, has broken my head; nevertheless I am 
always at</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">this rough exercise, which inspires me like a passion. 
Please, then,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to try a fall with me, whereby you will do yourself good 
as well as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">me.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. I consent; lead me whither you will, for I know 
that you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are like destiny; no man can escape from any argument 
which you may</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">weave for him. But I am not disposed to go further than 
you suggest.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Once will be enough; and now take particular care 
that we do</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not again unwittingly expose ourselves to the reproach 
of talking</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">childishly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. I will do my best to avoid that error.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. In the first place, let us return to our old 
objection, and see</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">whether we were right in blaming and taking offence at 
Protagoras on</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the ground that he assumed all to be equal and 
sufficient in wisdom;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">although he admitted that there was a better and worse, 
and that in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">respect of this, some who as he said were the wise 
excelled others.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Very true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Had Protagoras been living and answered for 
himself, instead of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">our answering for him, there would have been no need of 
our</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">reviewing or reinforcing the argument. But as he is not 
here, and some</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one may accuse us of speaking without authority on his 
behalf, had</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">we not better come to a clearer agreement about his 
meaning, for a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">great deal may be at stake?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>170 &nbsp;</b> Soc. Then let us obtain, not through any 
third person, but from</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">his own statement and in the fewest words possible, the 
basis of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">agreement.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. In what way?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. In this way:-His words are, &quot;What seems to a man, 
is to him.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Yes, so he says.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And are not we, Protagoras, uttering the opinion 
of man, or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">rather of all mankind, when we say that every one thinks 
himself wiser</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">than other men in some things, and their inferior in 
others? In the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">hour of danger, when they are in perils of war, or of 
the sea, or of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sickness, do they not look up to their commanders as if 
they were</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">gods, and expect salvation from them, only because they 
excel them</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in knowledge? Is not the world full of men in their 
several</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">employments, who are looking for teachers and rulers of 
themselves and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of the animals? and there are plenty who think that they 
are able to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">teach and able to rule. Now, in all this is implied that 
ignorance and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wisdom exist among them, least in their own opinion.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And wisdom is assumed by them to be true thought, 
and ignorance</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to be false opinion.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Exactly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. How then, Protagoras, would you have us treat the 
argument?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Shall we say that the opinions of men are always true, 
or sometimes</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">true and sometimes false? In either case, the result is 
the same,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and their opinions are not always true, but sometimes 
true and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sometimes false. For tell me, Theodorus, do you suppose 
that you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">yourself, or any other follower of Protagoras, would 
contend that no</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one deems another ignorant or mistaken in his opinion?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. The thing is incredible, Socrates.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And yet that absurdity is necessarily involved in 
the thesis</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which declares man to be the measure of all things.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. How so?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Why, suppose that you determine in your own mind 
something to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be true, and declare your opinion to me; let us assume, 
as he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">argues, that this is true to you. Now, if so, you must 
either say that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the rest of us are not the judges of this opinion or 
judgment of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">yours, or that we judge you always to have a true 
opinion: But are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">there not thousands upon thousands who, whenever you 
form a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">judgment, take up arms against you and are of an 
opposite judgment and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opinion, deeming that you judge falsely?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Yes, indeed, Socrates, thousands and tens of 
thousands, as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Homer says, who give me a world of trouble.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Well, but are we to assert that what you think is 
true to you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and false to the ten thousand others?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. No other inference seems to be possible.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And how about Protagoras himself? If neither he 
nor the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">multitude thought, as indeed they do not think, that man 
is the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">measure of all things, must it not follow that the truth 
of which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>171 </b>Protagoras wrote would be true to no one? But 
if you suppose that he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">himself thought this, and that the multitude does not 
agree with</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">him, you must begin by allowing that in whatever 
proportion the many</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are more than one, in that proportion his truth is more 
untrue than</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. That would follow if the truth is supposed to 
vary with</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">individual opinion.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And the best of the joke is, that he acknowledges 
the truth</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of their opinion who believe his own opinion to be 
false; for he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">admits that the opinions of all men are true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And does he not allow that his own opinion is 
false, if he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">admits that the opinion of those who think him false is 
true?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Of course.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Whereas the other side do not admit that they 
speak falsely?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. They do not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And he, as may be inferred from his writings, 
agrees that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">this opinion is also true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Clearly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then all mankind, beginning with Protagoras, will 
contend, or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">rather, I should say that he will allow, when he 
concedes that his</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">adversary has a true opinion-Protagoras, I say, will 
himself allow</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that neither a dog nor any ordinary man is the measure 
of anything</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which he has not learned-am I not right?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And the truth of Protagoras being doubted by all, 
will be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">true neither to himself to any one else?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. I think, Socrates, that we are running my old 
friend too</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">hard.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But do not know that we are going beyond the 
truth.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Doubtless, as he is older, he may be expected to be 
wiser than we are.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">And if he could only just get his head out of the world 
below, he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">would have overthrown both of us again and again, me for 
talking</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">nonsense and you for assenting to me, and have been off 
and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">underground in a trice. But as he is not within call, we 
must make the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">best use of our own faculties, such as they are, and 
speak out what</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">appears to us to be true. And one thing which no one 
will deny is,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that there are great differences in the understandings 
of men.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. In that opinion I quite agree.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And is there not most likely to be firm ground in 
the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">distinction which we were indicating on behalf of 
Protagoras, viz.,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that most things, and all immediate sensations, such as 
hot, dry,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sweet, are only such as they appear; if however 
difference of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opinion is to be allowed at all, surely we must allow it 
in respect of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">health or disease? for every woman, child, or living 
creature has</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not such a knowledge of what conduces to health as to 
enable them to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">cure themselves.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. I quite agree.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>172</b>&nbsp; Soc. Or again, in politics, while affirming 
that just and unjust,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">honourable and disgraceful, holy and unholy, are in 
reality to each</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">state such as the state thinks and makes lawful, and 
that in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">determining these matters no individual or state is 
wiser than</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">another, still the followers of Protagoras will not deny 
that in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">determining what is or is not expedient for the 
community one state is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wiser and one counsellor better that another-they will 
scarcely</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">venture to maintain, that what a city enacts in the 
belief that it</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is expedient will always be really expedient. But in the 
other case, I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">mean when they speak of justice and injustice, piety and 
impiety, they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are confident that in nature these have no existence or 
essence of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">their own-the truth is that which is agreed on at the 
time of the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">agreement, and as long as the agreement lasts; and this 
is the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">philosophy of many who do not altogether go along with 
Protagoras.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Here arises a new question, Theodorus, which threatens 
to be more</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">serious than the last.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Well, Socrates, we have plenty of leisure.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. That is true, and your remark recalls to my mind 
an observation</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which I have often made, that those who have passed 
their days in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the pursuit of philosophy are ridiculously at fault when 
they have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to appear and speak in court. How natural is this!</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. What do you mean?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I mean to say, that those who have been trained 
in philosophy</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and liberal pursuits are as unlike those who from their 
youth</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">upwards have been knocking about in the courts and such 
places, as a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">freeman is in breeding unlike a slave.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. In what is the difference seen?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. In the leisure spoken of by you, which a freeman 
can always</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">command: he has his talk, out in peace, and, like 
ourselves, he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wanders at will from one subject to another, and from a 
second to a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">third,-if the fancy takes him he begins again, as we are 
doing now,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">caring not whether his words are many or few; his only 
aim is to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">attain the truth. But the lawyer is always in a hurry; 
there is the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">water of the clepsydra driving him on, and not allowing 
him to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">expatiate at will: and there is his adversary standing 
over him,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">enforcing his rights; the indictment, which in their 
phraseology is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">termed the affidavit, is recited at the time: and from 
this he must</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not deviate. He is a servant, and is continually 
disputing about a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">fellow servant before his master, who is seated, and has 
the cause</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in his hands; the trial is never about some indifferent 
matter, but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">always concerns himself; and often the race is for his 
life. The</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">consequence has been, that he has become keen and 
shrewd; he has</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">learned how to flatter his master in word and indulge 
him in deed; but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">his soul is small and unrighteous. His condition, which 
has been</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that of a slave from his youth upwards, has deprived him 
of growth and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">uprightness and independence; dangers and fears, which 
were too much</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">for his truth and honesty, came upon him in early years, 
when the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">tenderness of youth was unequal to them, and he has been 
driven into</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">crooked ways; from the first he has practised deception 
and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>173 </b>retaliation, and has become stunted and 
warped. And so he has passed</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">out of youth into manhood, having no soundness in him; 
and is now,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">as he thinks, a master in wisdom. Such is the lawyer, 
Theodorus.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Will you have the companion picture of the philosopher, 
who is of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">our brotherhood; or shall we return to the argument? Do 
not let us</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">abuse the freedom of digression which we claim.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Nay, Socrates, not until we have finished what 
we are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">about; for you truly said that we belong to a 
brotherhood which is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">free, and are not the servants of the argument; but the 
argument is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">our servant, and must wait our leisure. Who is our 
judge? Or where</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is the spectator having any right to censure or control 
us, as he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">might the poets?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then, as this is your wish, I will describe the 
leaders; for</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">there is no use in talking about the inferior sort. In 
the first</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">place, the lords of philosophy have never, from their 
youth upwards,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">known their way to the Agora, or the dicastery, or the 
council, or any</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">other political assembly; they neither see nor hear the 
laws or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">decrees, as they are called, of the state written or 
recited; the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">eagerness of political societies in the attainment of 
office-clubs,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and banquets, and revels, and singing-maidens,-do not 
enter even</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">into their dreams. Whether any event has turned out well 
or ill in the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">city, what disgrace may have descended to any one from 
his</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ancestors, male or female, are matters of which the 
philosopher no</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">more knows than he can tell, as they say, how many pints 
are contained</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in the ocean. Neither is he conscious of his ignorance. 
For he does</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not hold aloof in order; that he may gain a reputation; 
but the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">truth is, that the outer form of him only is in the 
city: his mind,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">disdaining the littlenesses and nothingnesses of human 
things, is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&quot;flying all abroad&quot; as Pindar says, measuring earth and 
heaven and the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">things which are under and on the earth and above the 
heaven,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">interrogating the whole nature of each and all in their 
entirety,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">but not condescending to anything which is within reach.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>174</b>&nbsp; Theod. What do you mean, Socrates?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I will illustrate my meaning, Theodorus, by the 
jest which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the clever witty Thracian handmaid is said to have made 
about</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Thales, when he fell into a well as he was looking up at 
the stars.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">She said, that he was so eager to know what was going on 
in heaven,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that he could not see what was before his feet. This is 
a jest which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is equally applicable to all philosophers. For the 
philosopher is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wholly unacquainted with his next-door neighbour; he is 
ignorant,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not only of what he is doing, but he hardly knows 
whether he is a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">man or an animal; he is searching into the essence of 
man, and busy in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">enquiring what belongs to such a nature to do or suffer 
different from</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">any other;-I think that you understand me, Theodorus?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. I do, and what you say is true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And thus, my friend, on every occasion, private 
as well as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">public, as I said at first, when he appears in a 
law-court, or in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">any place in which he has to speak of things which are 
at his feet and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">before his eyes, he is the jest, not only of Thracian 
handmaids but of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the general herd, tumbling into wells and every sort of 
disaster</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">through his inexperience. His awkwardness is fearful, 
and gives the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">impression of imbecility. When he is reviled, he has 
nothing</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">personal to say in answer to the civilities of his 
adversaries, for he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knows no scandals of any one, and they do not interest 
him; and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">therefore he is laughed at for his sheepishness; and 
when others are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">being praised and glorified, in the simplicity of his 
heart he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">cannot help going into fits of laughter, so that he 
seems to be a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">downright idiot. When he hears a tyrant or king 
eulogized, he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">fancies that he is listening to the praises of some 
keeper of cattle-a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">swineherd, or shepherd, or perhaps a cowherd, who is 
congratulated</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">on the quantity of milk which he squeezes from them; and 
he remarks</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that the creature whom they tend, and out of whom they 
squeeze the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wealth, is of a less traitable and more insidious 
nature. Then, again,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he observes that the great man is of necessity as 
ill-mannered and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">uneducated as any shepherd-for he has no leisure, and he 
is surrounded</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">by a wall, which is his mountain-pen. Hearing of 
enormous landed</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">proprietors of ten thousand acres and more, our 
philosopher deems this</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to be a trifle, because he has been accustomed to think 
of the whole</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">earth; and when they sing the, praises of family, and 
say that someone</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is a gentleman because he can show seven generations of 
wealthy</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ancestors, he thinks that their sentiments only betray a 
dull and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">narrow vision in those who utter them, and who are not 
educated enough</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to look at the whole, nor to consider that every man has 
had thousands</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and ten thousands of progenitors, and among them have 
been rich and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>175</b> poor, kings and slaves, Hellenes and 
barbarians, innumerable. And when</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">people pride themselves on having a pedigree of 
twenty-five ancestors,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which goes back to Heracles, the son of Amphitryon, he 
cannot</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">understand their poverty of ideas. Why are they unable 
to calculate</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that Amphitryon had a twenty-fifth ancestor, who might 
have been</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">anybody, and was such as fortune made him and he had a 
fiftieth, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">so on? He amuses himself with the notion that they 
cannot count, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thinks that a little arithmetic would have got rid of 
their</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">senseless vanity. Now, in all these cases our 
philosopher is derided</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">by the vulgar, partly because he is thought to despise 
them, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">also because he is ignorant of what is before him, and 
always at a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">loss.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. That is very true, Socrates.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But, O my friend, when he draws the other into 
upper air, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">gets him out of his pleas and rejoinders into the 
contemplation of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">justice and injustice in their own nature and in their 
difference from</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one another and from all other things; or from the 
commonplaces</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">about the happiness of a king or of a rich man to the 
consideration of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">government, and of human happiness and misery in 
general-what they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are, and how a man is to attain the one and avoid the 
other-when</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that narrow, keen, little legal mind is called to 
account about all</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">this, he gives the philosopher his revenge; for dizzied 
by the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">height at which he is hanging, whence he looks down into 
space,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which is a strange experience to him, he being dismayed, 
and lost, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">stammering broken words, is laughed at, not by Thracian 
handmaidens or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">any other uneducated persons, for they have no eye for 
the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">situation, but by every man who has not been brought up 
a slave.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Such are the two characters, Theodorus: the one of the 
freeman, who</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">has becomes trained in liberty and leisure, whom you 
call the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">philosopher-him we cannot blame because he appears 
simple and of no</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">account when he has to perform some menial task, such as 
packing up</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">bed-clothes, or flavouring a sauce or fawning speech; 
the other</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">character is that of the man who is able to do all this 
kind of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>176 </b>service smartly and neatly, but knows not how 
to wear his cloak like a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">gentleman; still less with the music of discourse can he 
hymn the true</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">life aright which is lived by immortals or men blessed 
of heaven.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. If you could only persuade everybody, Socrates, 
as you do me,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of the truth of your words, there would be more peace 
and fewer</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">evils among men.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Evils, Theodorus, can never pass away; for there 
must always</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">remain something which is antagonistic to good. Having 
no place</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">among the gods in heaven, of necessity they hover around 
the mortal</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">nature, and this earthly sphere. Wherefore we ought to 
fly away from</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">earth to heaven as quickly as we can; and to fly away is 
to become</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">like God, as far as this is possible; and to become like 
him, is to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">become holy, just, and wise. But, O my friend, you 
cannot easily</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">convince mankind that they should pursue virtue or avoid 
vice, not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">merely in order that a man may seem to be good, which is 
the reason</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">given by the world, and in my judgment is only a 
repetition of an</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">old wives fable. Whereas, the truth is that God is never 
in any way</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">unrighteous-he is perfect righteousness; and he of us 
who is the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">most righteous is most like him. Herein is seen the true 
cleverness of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">a man, and also his nothingness and want of manhood. For 
to know</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">this is true wisdom and virtue, and ignorance of this is 
manifest</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">folly and vice. All other kinds of wisdom or cleverness, 
which seem</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">only, such as the wisdom of politicians, or the wisdom 
of the arts,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are coarse and vulgar. The unrighteous man, or the sayer 
and doer of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">unholy things, had far better not be encouraged in the 
illusion that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">his roguery is clever; for men glory in their shame 
-they fancy that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">they hear others saying of them, &quot;These are not mere 
good-for</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">nothing persons, mere burdens of the earth, but such as 
men should</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be who mean to dwell safely in a state.&quot; Let us tell 
them that they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are all the more truly what they do not think they are 
because they do</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not know it; for they do not know the penalty of 
injustice, which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">above all things they ought to know-not stripes and 
death, as they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">suppose, which evil-doers often escape, but a penalty 
which cannot</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be escaped.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. What is that?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. There are two patterns eternally set before them; 
the one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">blessed and divine, the other godless and wretched: but 
they do not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">see them, or perceive that in their utter folly and 
infatuation they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>177 </b>are growing like the one and unlike the 
other, by reason of their evil</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">deeds; and the penalty is, that they lead a life 
answering to the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">pattern which they are growing like. And if we tell 
them, that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">unless they depart from their cunning, the place of 
innocence will not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">receive them after death; and that here on earth, they 
will live</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ever in the likeness of their own evil selves, and with 
evil</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">friends-when they hear this they in their superior 
cunning will seem</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to be listening to the talk of idiots.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Very true, Socrates.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;Soc. Too true, my friend, as I well know; there is, 
however, one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">peculiarity in their case: when they begin to reason in 
private</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">about their dislike of philosophy, if they have the 
courage to hear</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the argument out and do not run away, they grow at last 
strangely</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">discontented with themselves; their rhetoric fades away, 
and they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">become helpless as children. These however are 
digressions from</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which we must now desist, or they will overflow, and 
drown the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">original argument; to which, if you please, we will now 
return.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. For my part, Socrates, I would rather have the 
digressions,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">for at my age I find them easier to follow; but if you 
wish, let us go</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">back to the argument.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Had we not reached the point at which the 
partisans of the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perpetual flux, who say that things are as they seem to 
each one, were</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">confidently maintaining that the ordinances which the 
state</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">commanded 2nd thought just, were just to the state which 
imposed them,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">while they were in force; this was especially asserted 
of justice; but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">as to the good, no one had any longer the hardihood to 
contend of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">any ordinances which the state thought and enacted to be 
good that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">these, while they were in force, were really good;-he 
who said so</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">would be playing with the name &quot;good,&quot; and would, not 
touch the real</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">question-it would be a mockery, would it not?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Certainly it would.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. He ought not to speak of the name, but of the 
thing which is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">contemplated under the name.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Right.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Whatever be the term used, the good or expedient 
is the aim</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of legislation, and as far as she has an opinion, the 
state imposes</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">all laws with a view to the greatest expediency; can 
legislation</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have any other aim?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>178&nbsp;</b> Theod. Certainly not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But is the aim attained always? do not mistakes 
often happen?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Yes, I think that there are mistakes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. The possibility of error will be more distinctly 
recognized, if</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">we put the question in reference to the whole class 
under which the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">good or expedient fall That whole class has to do with 
the future, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">laws are passed under the idea that they will be useful 
in after-time;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which, in other words, is the future.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Very true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Suppose now, that we ask Protagoras, or one of 
his disciples, a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">question:-O, Protagoras, we will say to him, Man is, as 
you declare,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the measure of all things-white, heavy, light: of all 
such things he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is the judge; for he has the criterion of them in 
himself, and when he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thinks that things are such as he experiences them to 
be, he thinks</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">what is and is true to himself. Is it not so?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And do you extend your doctrine, Protagoras (as 
we shall</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">further say), to the future as well as to the present; 
and has he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the criterion not only of what in his opinion is but of 
what will</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be, and do things always happen to him as he expected? 
For example,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">take the case of heat:-When an ordinary man thinks that 
he is going to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have a fever, and that this kind of heat is coming on, 
and another</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">person, who is a physician, thinks the contrary, whose 
opinion is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">likely to prove right? Or are they both right?-he will 
have a heat and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">fever in his own judgment, and not have a fever in the 
physician's</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">judgment?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. How ludicrous!</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And the vinegrower, if I am not mistaken, is a 
better judge</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of the sweetness or dryness of the vintage which is not 
yet gathered</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">than the harp-player?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And in musical composition-the musician will know 
better than</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the training master what the training master himself 
will hereafter</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">think harmonious or the reverse?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Of course.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And the cook will be a better judge than the 
guest, who is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not a cook, of the pleasure to be derived from the 
dinner which is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in preparation; for of present or past pleasure we are 
not as yet</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">arguing; but can we say that every one will be to 
himself the best</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">judge of the pleasure which will seem to be and will be 
to him in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the future?-nay, would not you, Protagoras, better guess 
which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">arguments in a court would convince any one of us than 
the ordinary</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">man?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Certainly, Socrates, he used to profess in the 
strongest</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">manner that he was the superior of all men in this 
respect.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>179&nbsp;</b> Soc. To be sure, friend: who would have paid 
a large sum for the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">privilege of talking to him, if he had really persuaded 
his visitors</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that neither a prophet nor any other man was better able 
to judge what</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">will be and seem to be in the future than every one 
could for himself?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Who indeed?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And legislation and expediency are all concerned 
with the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">future; and every one will admit that states, in passing 
laws, must</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">often fail of their highest interests?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Quite true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then we may fairly argue against your master, 
that he must</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">admit one man to be wiser than another, and that the 
wiser is a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">measure: but I, who know nothing, am not at all obliged 
to accept</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the honour which the advocate of Protagoras was just now 
forcing</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">upon me, whether I would or not, of being a measure of 
anything.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. That is the best refutation of him, Socrates; 
although he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is also caught when he ascribes truth to the opinions of 
others, who</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">give the lie direct to his own opinion.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. There are many ways, Theodorus, in which the 
doctrine that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">every opinion of: every man is true may be refuted; but 
there is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">more difficulty, in proving that states of feeling, 
which are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">present to a man, and out of which arise sensations and 
opinions in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">accordance with them, are also untrue. And very likely I 
have been</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">talking nonsense about them; for they may be 
unassailable, and those</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">who say that there is clear evidence of them, and that 
they are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">matters of knowledge, may probably be right; in which 
case our</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">friend Theaetetus was not so far from the mark when he 
identified</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perception and knowledge. And therefore let us draw 
nearer, as the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">advocate of Protagoras desires; and the truth of the 
universal flux</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">a ring: is the theory sound or not? at any rate, no 
small war is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">raging about it, and there are combination not a few.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. No small, war, indeed, for in most the sect 
makes rapid</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">strides, the disciples of Heracleitus are most 
energetic. upholders of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the doctrine.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then we are the more bound, my dear Theodorus, to 
examine the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">question from the foundation as it is set forth by 
themselves.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Certainly we are. About these speculations of 
Heracleitus,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which, as you say, are as old as Homer, or even older 
still, the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Ephesians themselves, who profess to know them, are 
downright mad, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you cannot talk with them on the subject. For, in 
accordance with</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">their text-books, they are always in motion; but as for 
dwelling</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>180</b> upon an argument or a question, and quietly 
asking and answering in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">turn, they can no more do so than they can fly; or 
rather, the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">determination of these fellows not to have a particle of 
rest in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">them is more than the utmost powers of negation can 
express. If you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ask any of them a question, he will produce, as from a 
quiver, sayings</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">brief and dark, and shoot them at you; and if you 
inquire the reason</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of what he has said, you will be hit by some other 
newfangled word,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and will make no way with any of them, nor they with one 
another;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">their great care is, not to allow of any settled 
principle either in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">their arguments or in their minds, conceiving, as I 
imagine, that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">any such principle would be stationary; for they are at 
war with the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">stationary, and do what they can to drive it out 
everywhere.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I suppose, Theodorus, that you have only seen 
them when they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">were fighting, and have never stayed with them in time 
of peace, for</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">they are no friends of yours; and their peace doctrines 
are only</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">communicated by them at leisure, as I imagine, to those 
disciples of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">theirs whom they want to make like themselves.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Disciples! my good sir, they have none; men of 
their sort are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not one another's disciples, but they grow up at their 
own sweet will,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and get their inspiration anywhere, each of them saying 
of his</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">neighbour that he knows nothing. Fro these men, then, as 
I was going</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to remark, you will never get a reason, whether with 
their will or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">without their will; we must take the question out of 
their hands,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and make the analysis ourselves, as if we were doing 
geometrical</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">problem.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Quite right too; but as touching the aforesaid 
problem, have we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not heard from the ancients, who concealed their wisdom 
from the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">many in poetical figures, that Oceanus and Tethys, the 
origin of all</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">things, are streams, and that nothing is at rest? And 
now the moderns,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in their superior wisdom, have declared the same openly, 
that the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">cobbler too may hear and learn of them, and no longer 
foolishly</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">imagine that some things are at rest and others in 
motion-having</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">learned that all is motion, he will duly honour his 
teachers. I had</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">almost forgotten the opposite doctrine, Theodorus,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone Being remains unmoved, which is the name for 
the all.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">This is the language of Parmenides, Melissus, and their 
followers, who</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>181</b> stoutly maintain that all being is one and 
self-contained, and has</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">no place which to move. What shall we do, friend, with 
all these</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">people; for, advancing step by step, we have 
imperceptibly got between</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the combatants, and, unless we can protect our retreat, 
we shall pay</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the penalty of our rashness-like the players in the 
palaestra who</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are caught upon the line, and are dragged different ways 
by the two</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">parties. Therefore I think that we had better begin by 
considering</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">those whom we first accosted, &quot;the river-gods,&quot; and, if 
we find any</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">truth in them, we will help them to pull us over, and 
try to get</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">away from the others. But if the partisans of &quot;the 
whole&quot; appear to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">speak more truly, we will fly off from the party which 
would move</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the immovable, to them. And if I find that neither of 
them have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">anything reasonable to say, we shall be in a ridiculous 
position,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">having so great a conceit of our own poor opinion and 
rejecting that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of ancient and famous men. O Theodorus, do you think 
that there is any</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">use in proceeding when the danger is so great?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Nay, Socrates, not to examine thoroughly what 
the two parties</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have to say would be quite intolerable.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then examine we must, since you, who were so 
reluctant. to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">begin, are so eager to proceed. The nature of motion 
appears to be the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">question with which we begin. What do they mean when 
they say that all</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">things are in motion? Is there only one kind of motion, 
or, as I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">rather incline to think, two? should like to have your 
opinion upon</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">this point in addition to my own, that I may err, if I 
must err, in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">your company; tell me, then, when a thing changes from 
one place to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">another, or goes round in the same place, is not that 
what is called</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">motion?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Here then we have one kind of motion. But when a 
thing,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">remaining on the same spot, grows old, or becomes black 
from being</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">white, or hard from being soft, or undergoes any other 
change, may not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">this be properly called motion of another kind?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. I think so.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Say rather that it must be so. Of motion then 
there are these</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">two kinds, &quot;change,&quot; and &quot;motion in place.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. You are right.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And now, having made this distinction, let us 
address ourselves</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to those who say that all is motion, and ask them 
whether all things</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">according to them have the two kinds of motion, and are 
changed as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">well as move in place, or is one thing moved in both 
ways, and another</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in one only?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Indeed, I do not know what to answer; but I 
think they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">would say that all things are moved in both ways.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Yes, comrade; for, if not, they would have to say 
that the same</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">things are in motion and at rest, and there would be no 
more truth</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in saying that all things are in motion, than that all 
things are at</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">rest.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. To be sure.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>182&nbsp;</b> Soc. And if they are to be in motion, and 
nothing is to be devoid of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">motion, all things must always have every sort of 
motion?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Most true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Consider a further point: did we not understand 
them to explain</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the generation of heat, whiteness, or anything else, in 
some such</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">manner as the following:-were they not saying that each 
of them is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">moving between the agent and the patient, together with 
a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perception, and that the patient ceases to be a 
perceiving power and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">becomes a percipient, and the agent a quale instead of a 
quality? I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">suspect that quality may appear a strange and uncouth 
term to you, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that you do not understand the abstract expression. Then 
I will take</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">concrete instances: I mean to say that the producing 
power or agent</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">becomes neither heat nor whiteness but hot and white, 
and the like</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of other things. For I must repeat what I said before, 
that neither</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the agent nor patient have any absolute existence, but 
when they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">come together and generate sensations and their objects, 
the one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">becomes a thing a certain quality, and the other a 
percipient. You</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">remember?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Of course.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. We may leave the details of their theory 
unexamined, but we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">must not forget to ask them the only question with which 
we are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">concerned: Are all things in motion and flux?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Yes, they will reply.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And they are moved in both those ways which we 
distinguished,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that is to Way, they move in place and are also changed?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Of course, if the motion is to be perfect.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. If they only moved in place and were not changed, 
we should</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be able to say what is the nature of the things which 
are in motion</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and flux.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Exactly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But now, since not even white continues to flow 
white, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">whiteness itself is a flux or change which is passing 
into another</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">colour, and is never to be caught standing still, can 
the name of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">any colour be rightly used at all?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. How is that possible, Socrates, either in the 
case of this or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of any other quality-if while we are using the word the 
object is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">escaping in the flux?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And what would you say of perceptions, such as 
sight and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">hearing, or any other kind of perception? Is there any 
stopping in the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">act of seeing and hearing?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Certainly not, if all things are in motion.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then we must not speak of seeing any more than of 
not-seeing,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">nor of any other perception more than of any 
non-perception, if all</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">things partake of every kind of motion?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Certainly not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Yet perception is knowledge: so at least 
Theaetetus and I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">were saying.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Very true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then when we were asked what is knowledge, we no 
more</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">answered what is knowledge than what is not knowledge?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. I suppose not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>183</b>&nbsp; Soc. Here, then, is a fine result: we 
corrected our first answer</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in our eagerness to prove that nothing is at rest. But 
if nothing is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">at rest, every answer upon whatever subject is equally 
right: you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">may say that a thing is or is not thus; or, if you 
prefer, &quot;becomes&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thus; and if we say &quot;becomes,&quot; we shall not then hamper 
them with</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">words expressive of rest.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Quite true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Yes, Theodorus, except in saying &quot;thus&quot; and &quot;not 
thus.&quot; But you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ought not to use the word &quot;thus,&quot; for there is no motion 
in &quot;thus&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">or in &quot;not thus.&quot; The maintainers of the doctrine have 
as yet no words</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in which to express themselves, and must get a new 
language. I know of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">no word that will suit them, except perhaps &quot;no how,&quot; 
which is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perfectly indefinite.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Yes, that is a manner of speaking in which they 
will be quite</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">at home.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And so, Theodorus, we have got rid of your friend 
without</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">assenting to his doctrine, that every man is the measure 
of all</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">things-a wise man only is a measure; neither can we 
allow that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge is perception, certainly not on the hypothesis 
of a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perpetual flux, unless perchance our friend Theaetetus 
is able to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">convince us that it is.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Very good, Socrates; and now that the argument 
about the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">doctrine of Protagoras has been completed, I am absolved 
from</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">answering; for this was the agreement.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Not, Theodorus, until you and Socrates have 
discussed the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">doctrine of those who say that all things are at rest, 
as you were</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">proposing.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. You, Theaetetus, who are a young rogue, must 
not instigate</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">your elders to a breach of faith, but should prepare to 
answer</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Socrates in the remainder of the argument.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, if he wishes; but I would rather have 
heard about the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">doctrine of rest.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Invite Socrates to an argument-invite horsemen 
to the open</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">plain; do but ask him, and he will answer.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Nevertheless, Theodorus, I am afraid that I shall 
not be able</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to comply with the request of Theaetetus.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theod. Not comply! for what reason?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. My reason is that I have a kind of reverence; not 
so much for</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Melissus and the others, who say that &quot;All is one and at 
rest,&quot; as for</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the great leader himself, Parmenides, venerable and 
awful, as in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Homeric language he may be called;-him I should be 
ashamed to approach</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in a spirit unworthy of him. I met him when he was an 
old man, and I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">was a mere youth, and he appeared to me to have a 
glorious depth of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>184</b> mind. And I am afraid that we may not 
understand his words, and may be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">still further from understanding his meaning; above all 
I fear that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the nature of knowledge, which is the main subject of 
our</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">discussion, may be thrust out of sight by the unbidden 
guests who will</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">come pouring in upon our feast of discourse, if we let 
them</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in-besides, the question which is now stirring is of 
immense extent,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and will be treated unfairly if only considered by the 
way; or if</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">treated adequately and at length, will put into the 
shade the other</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">question of knowledge. Neither the one nor the other can 
be allowed;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">but I must try by my art of midwifery to deliver 
Theaetetus of his</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">conceptions about knowledge.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very well; do so if you will.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then now, Theaetetus, take another view of the 
subject: you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">answered that knowledge is perception?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I did.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And if any one were to ask you: With what does a 
man see</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">black and white colours? and with what does he hear high 
and low</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sounds?-you would say, if I am not mistaken, &quot;With the 
eyes and with</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the ears.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I should.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. The free use of words and phrases, rather than 
minute</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">precision, is generally characteristic of a liberal 
education, and the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opposite is pedantic; but sometimes precision. is 
necessary, and I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">believe that the answer which you have just given is 
open to the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">charge of incorrectness; for which is more correct, to 
say that we see</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">or hear with the eyes and with the ears, or through the 
eyes and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">through the ears.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I should say &quot;through,&quot; Socrates, rather than 
&quot;with.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Yes, my boy, for no one can suppose that in each 
of us, as in a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sort of Trojan horse, there are perched a number of 
unconnected</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">senses, which do not all meet in some one nature, the 
mind, or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">whatever we please to call it, of which they are the 
instruments,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and with which through them we perceive objects of 
sense.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I agree with you in that opinion.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. The reason why I am thus precise is, because I 
want to know</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">whether, when we perceive black and white through the 
eyes, and again,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">other qualities through other organs, we do not perceive 
them with one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and the same part of ourselves, and, if you were asked, 
you might</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">refer all such perceptions to the body. Perhaps, 
however, I had better</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">allow you to answer for yourself and not interfere; Tell 
me, then, are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not the organs through which you perceive warm and hard 
and light</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and sweet, organs of the body?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Of the body, certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>185 </b>&nbsp; Soc. And you would admit that what you 
perceive through one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">faculty you cannot perceive through another; the objects 
of hearing,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">for example, cannot be perceived through sight, or the 
objects of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sight through hearing?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Of course not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. If you have any thought about both of them, this 
common</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perception cannot come to you, either through the one or 
the other</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">organ?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. It cannot.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. How about sounds and colours: in the first place 
you would</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">admit that they both exist?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And that either of them is different from the 
other, and the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">same with itself?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And that both are two and each of them one?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. You can further observe whether they are like or 
unlike one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">another?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I dare say.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But through what do you perceive all this about 
them? for</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">neither through hearing nor yet through seeing can you 
apprehend</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that which they have in common. Let me give you an 
illustration of the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">point at issue:-If there were any meaning in asking 
whether sounds and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">colours are saline or not, you would be able to tell me 
what faculty</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">would consider the question. It would not be sight or 
hearing, but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">some other.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly; the faculty of taste.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Very good; and now tell me what is the power 
which discerns,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not only in sensible objects, but in all things, 
universal notions,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">such as those which are called being and not-being, and 
those others</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">about which we were just asking-what organs will you 
assign for the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perception of these notions?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. You are thinking of being and not being, 
likeness and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">unlikeness, sameness and difference, and also of unity 
and other</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">numbers which are applied to objects of sense; and you 
mean to ask,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">through what bodily organ the soul perceives odd and 
even numbers</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and other arithmetical conceptions.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. You follow me excellently, Theaetetus; that is 
precisely what I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">am asking.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Indeed, Socrates, I cannot answer; my only 
notion is, that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">these, unlike objects of sense, have no separate organ, 
but that the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">mind, by a power of her own, contemplates the universals 
in all</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">things.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. You are a beauty, Theaetetus, and not ugly, as 
Theodorus was</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">saying; for he who utters the beautiful is himself 
beautiful and good.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">And besides being beautiful, you have done me a kindness 
in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">releasing me from a very long discussion, if you are 
clear that the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">soul views some things by herself and others through the 
bodily</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">organs. For that was my own opinion, and I wanted you to 
agree with</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">me.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I am quite clear.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>186</b>&nbsp; Soc. And to which class would you refer 
being or essence; for</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">this, of all our notions, is the most universal?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I should say, to that class which the soul 
aspires to know</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of herself.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;Soc. And would you say this also of like and unlike, 
same and other?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And would you say the same of the noble and base, 
and of good</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and evil?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. These I conceive to be notions which are 
essentially</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">relative, and which the soul also perceives by comparing 
in herself</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">things past and present with the future.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And does she not perceive the hardness of that 
which is hard by</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the touch, and the softness of that which is soft 
equally by the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">touch?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But their essence and what they are, and their 
opposition to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one another, and the essential nature of this 
opposition, the soul</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">herself endeavours to decide for us by the review and 
comparison of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">them?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. The simple sensations which reach the soul 
through the body are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">given at birth to men and animals by nature, but their 
reflections</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">on the being and use of them are slowly and hardly 
gained, if they are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ever gained, by education and long experience.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Assuredly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And can a man attain truth who fails of attaining 
being?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Impossible.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And can he who misses the truth of anything, have 
a knowledge</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of that thing?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. He cannot.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then knowledge does not consist in impressions of 
sense, but in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">reasoning about them; in that only, and not in the mere 
impression,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">truth and being can be attained?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And would you call the two processes by the same 
name, when</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">there is so great difference between them?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. That would certainly not be right.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And what name would you give to seeing, hearing, 
smelling,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">being cold and being hot?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I should call all of them perceiving-what 
other name could</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be given to them?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Perception would be the collective name of them?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Which, as we say, has no part in the attainment 
of truth any</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">more of being?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And therefore not in. science or knowledge?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. No.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then perception, Theaetetus, can never be the 
same as knowledge</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">or science?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Clearly not, Socrates; and knowledge has now 
been most</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">distinctly proved to be different from perception.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>187&nbsp;</b> Soc. But the original aim of our discussion 
was to find out rather</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">what knowledge is than what it is not; at the same time 
we have made</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">some progress, for we no longer seek for knowledge, in 
perception at</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">all, but in that other process, however called, in which 
the mind is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">alone and engaged with being.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. You mean, Socrates, if I am not mistaken, what 
is called</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thinking or opining.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. You conceive truly. And now, my friend, Please to 
begin again</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">at this point; and having wiped out of your memory all 
that has</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">preceded, see if you have arrived at any clearer view, 
and once more</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">say what is knowledge.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I cannot say, Socrates, that all opinion is 
knowledge,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">because there may be a false opinion; but I will venture 
to assert,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that knowledge is true opinion: let this then be my 
reply; and if this</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is hereafter disproved, I must try to find another.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. That is the way in which you ought to answer, 
Theaetetus, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not in your former hesitating strain, for if we are bold 
we shall gain</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one of two advantages; either we shall find what we 
seek, or we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">shall be less likely to think that we know what we do 
not know-in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">either case we shall be richly rewarded. And now, what 
are you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">saying?-Are there two sorts of opinion, one true and the 
other</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">false; and do you define knowledge to be the true?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, according to my present view.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Is it still worth our while to resume the 
discussion touching</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opinion?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. To what are you alluding?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. There is a point which often troubles me, and is 
a great</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perplexity to me, both in regard to myself and others. I 
cannot make</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">out the nature or origin of the mental experience to 
which I refer.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Pray what is it?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. How there can be-false opinion-that difficulty 
still troubles</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the eye of my mind; and I am uncertain whether I shall 
leave the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">question, or over again in a new way.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Begin again, Socrates,-at least if you think 
that there is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the slightest necessity for doing so. Were not you and 
Theodorus</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">just now remarking very truly, that in discussions of 
this kind we may</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">take our own time?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. You are quite right, and perhaps there will be no 
harm in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">retracing our steps and beginning again. Better a little 
which is well</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">done, than a great deal imperfectly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Well, and what is the difficulty? Do we not speak 
of false</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opinion, and say that one man holds a false and another 
a true</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opinion, as though there were some natural distinction 
between them?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. We certainly say so.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>188&nbsp;</b> Soc. All things and everything are either 
known or not known. I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">leave out of view the intermediate conceptions of 
learning and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">forgetting, because they have nothing to do with our 
present question.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. There can be no doubt, Socrates, if you 
exclude these,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that there is no other alternative but knowing or not 
knowing a thing.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. That point being now determined, must we not say 
that he who</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">has an opinion, must have an opinion about something 
which he knows or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">does not know?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. He must.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. He who knows, cannot but know; and he who does 
not know, cannot</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">know?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Of course.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. What shall we say then? When a man has a false 
opinion does</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he think that which he knows to be some other thing 
which he knows,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and knowing both, is he at the same time ignorant of 
both?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. That, Socrates, is impossible.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But perhaps he thinks of something which he does 
not know as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">some other thing which he does not know; for example, he 
knows neither</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theaetetus nor Socrates, and yet he fancies that 
Theaetetus is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Socrates, or Socrates Theaetetus?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. How can he?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But surely he cannot suppose what he knows to be 
what he does</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not know, or what he does not know to be what he knows?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. That would be monstrous.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Where, then, is false opinion? For if all things 
are either</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">known or unknown, there can be no opinion which is not 
comprehended</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">under this alternative, and so false opinion is 
excluded.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaes. Most true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Suppose that we remove the question out of the 
sphere of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowing or not knowing, into that of being and 
not-being.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What do you mean?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. May we not suspect the simple truth to be that he 
who thinks</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">about anything, that which. is not, will necessarily 
think what is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">false, whatever in other respects may be the state of 
his mind?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. That, again, is not unlikely, Socrates.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then suppose some one to say to us, Theaetetus:-Is 
it</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">possible for any man to think that which is not, either 
as a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">self-existent substance or as a predicate of something 
else? And</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">suppose that we answer, &quot;Yes, he can, when he thinks 
what is not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">true.&quot;-That will be our answer?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But is there any parallel to this?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What do you mean?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Can a man see something and yet see nothing?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Impossible.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But if he sees any one thing, he sees something 
that exists. Do</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you suppose that what is one is ever to be found among 
nonexisting</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">things?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I do not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. He then who sees some one thing, sees something 
which is?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>189</b>&nbsp; Soc. And he who hears anything, hears some 
one thing, and hears that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which is?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And he who touches anything, touches something 
which is one and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">therefore is?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. That again is true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And does not he who thinks, think some one thing?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And does not he who thinks some one thing, think 
something</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which is?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I agree.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then he who thinks of that which is not, thinks 
of nothing?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And he who thinks of nothing, does not think at 
all?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Obviously.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then no one can think that which is not, either 
as a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">self-existent substance or as a predicate of something 
else?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Clearly not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then to think falsely is different from thinking 
that which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is not?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. It would seem so.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then false opinion has no existence in us, either 
in the sphere</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of being or of knowledge?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But may not the following be the description of 
what we express</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">by this name?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. May we not suppose that false opinion or thought 
is a sort of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">heterodoxy; a person may make an exchange in his mind, 
and say that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one real object is another real object. For thus he 
always thinks that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which is, but he puts one thing in place of another; and 
missing the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">aim of his thoughts, he may be truly said to have false 
opinion.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Now you appear to me to have spoken the exact 
truth: when</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">a man puts the base in the place of the noble, or the 
noble in the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">place of the base, then he has truly false opinion.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I see, Theaetetus, that your fear has 
disappeared, and that you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are beginning to despise me.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What makes you say so?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. You think, if I am not mistaken, that your &quot;truly 
false&quot; is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">safe from censure, and that I shall never ask whether 
there can be a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">swift which is slow, or a heavy which is light, or any 
other</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">self-contradictory thing, which works, not according to 
its own</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">nature, but according to that of its opposite. But I 
will not insist</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">upon this, for I do not wish needlessly to discourage 
you. And so</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you are satisfied that false opinion is heterodoxy, or 
the thought</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of something else?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I am.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. It is possible then upon your view for the mind 
to conceive</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of one thing as another?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But must not the mind, or thinking power, which 
misplaces them,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have a conception either of both objects or of one of 
them?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Either together or in succession?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very good.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And do you mean by conceiving, the same which I 
mean?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What is that?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I mean the conversation which the soul holds with 
herself in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">considering of anything. I speak of what I scarcely 
understand; but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the soul when thinking appears to me to be just 
talking-asking</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">questions of herself and answering them, affirming and 
denying. And</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>190</b> when she has arrived at a decision, either 
gradually or by a sudden</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">impulse, and has at last agreed, and does not doubt, 
this is called</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">her opinion. I say, then, that to form an opinion is to 
speak, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opinion is a word spoken,-I mean, to oneself and in 
silence, not aloud</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">or to another: What think you?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I agree.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then when any one thinks of one thing as another, 
he is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">saying to himself that one thing is another?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But do you ever remember saying to yourself that 
the noble is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">certainly base, or the unjust just; or, best of all-have 
you ever</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">attempted to convince yourself that one thing is 
another? Nay, not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">even in sleep, did you ever venture to say to yourself 
that odd is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">even, or anything of the kind?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Never.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And do you suppose that any other man, either in 
his senses</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">or out of them, ever seriously tried to persuade himself 
that an ox is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">a horse, or that two are one?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But if thinking is talking to oneself, no one 
speaking and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thinking of two objects, and apprehending them both in 
his soul,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">will say and think that the one is the other of them, 
and I must</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">add, that even you, lover of dispute as you are, had 
better let the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">word &quot;other&quot; alone [i.e., not insist that &quot;one&quot; and 
&quot;other&quot; are the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">same]. I mean to say, that no one thinks the noble to be 
base, or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">anything of the kind.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I will give up the word &quot;other,&quot; Socrates; and 
I agree to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">what you say.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. If a man has both of them in his thoughts, he 
cannot think that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the one of them is the other?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theat. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Neither, if he has one of them only in his mind 
and not the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">other, can he think that one is the other?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True; for we should have to suppose that he 
apprehends</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that which is not in his thoughts at all.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then no one who has either both or only one of 
the two</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">objects in his mind can think that the one is the other. 
And</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">therefore, he who maintains that false opinion is 
heterodoxy is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">talking nonsense; for neither in this, any more than in 
the previous</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">way, can false opinion exist in us.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. No.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But if, Theaetetus, this is not admitted, we 
shall be driven</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">into many absurdities.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What are they?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>191</b>&nbsp; Soc. I will not tell you until I have 
endeavoured to consider the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">matter from every point of view. For I should be ashamed 
of us if we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">were driven in our perplexity to admit the absurd 
consequences of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which I speak. But if we find the solution, and get away 
from them, we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">may regard them only as the difficulties of others, and 
the ridicule</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">will not attach to us. On the other hand, if we utterly 
fail, I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">suppose that we must be humble, and allow the argument 
to trample us</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">under foot, as the sea-sick passenger is trampled upon 
by the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sailor, and to do anything to us. Listen, then, while I 
tell you how I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">hope to find a way out of our difficulty.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Let me hear.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I think that we were wrong in denying that a man 
could think</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">what he knew to be what he did not know; and that there 
is a way in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which such a deception is possible.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. You mean to say, as I suspected at the time, 
that I may know</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Socrates, and at a distance see some one who is unknown 
to me, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">whom I mistake for him-them the deception will occur?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But has not that position been relinquished by 
us, because</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">involving the absurdity that we should know and not know 
the things</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which we know?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Let us make the assertion in another form, which 
may or may not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have a favourable issue; but as we are in a great 
strait, every</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">argument should be turned over and tested. Tell me, 
then, whether I am</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">right in saying that you may learn a thing which at one 
time you did</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not know?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly you may.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And another and another?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I would have you imagine, then, that there exists 
in the mind</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of man a block of wax, which is of different sizes in 
different men;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">harder, moister, and having more or less of purity in 
one than</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">another, and in some of an intermediate quality.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I see.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Let us say that this tablet is a gift of Memory, 
the mother</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of the Muses; and that when we wish to remember anything 
which we have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">seen, or heard, or thought in our own minds, we hold the 
wax to the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perceptions and thoughts, and in that material receive 
the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">impression of them as from the seal of a ring; and that 
we remember</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and know what is imprinted as long as the image lasts; 
but when the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">image is effaced, or cannot be taken, then we forget and 
do not know.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very good.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Now, when a person has this knowledge, and is 
considering</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">something which he sees or hears, may not false opinion 
arise in the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">following manner?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. In what manner?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. When he thinks what he knows, sometimes to be 
what he knows,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and sometimes to be what he does not know. We were wrong 
before in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">denying the possibility of this.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. And how would you amend the former statement?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>192&nbsp;</b> Soc. I should begin by making a list of the 
impossible cases which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">must be excluded. (1) No one can think one thing to be 
another when he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">does not perceive either of them, but has the memorial 
or seal of both</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of them in his mind; nor can any mistaking of one thing 
for another</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">occur, when he only knows one, and does not know, and 
has no</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">impression of the other; nor can he think that one thing 
which he does</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not know is another thing which he does not know, or 
that what he does</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not know is what he knows; nor (2) that one thing which 
he perceives</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is another thing which he perceives, or that something 
which he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perceives is something which he does not perceive; or 
that something</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which he does not perceive is something else which he 
does not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perceive; or that something which he does not perceive 
is something</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which he perceives; nor again (3) can he think that 
something which he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knows and perceives, and of which he has the impression 
coinciding</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">with sense, is something else which he knows and 
perceives, and of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which he has the impression coinciding with sense;-this 
last case,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">if possible, is still more inconceivable than the 
others; nor (4)</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">can he think that something which he knows and 
perceives, and of which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he has the memorial coinciding with sense, is something 
else which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he knows; nor so long as these agree, can he think that 
a thing</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which he knows and perceives is another thing which he 
perceives; or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that a thing which he does not know and does not 
perceive, is the same</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">as another thing which he does not know and does not 
perceive;-nor</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">again, can he suppose that a thing which he does not 
know and does not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perceive is the same as another thing which he does not 
know; or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that a thing which he does not know and does not 
perceive is another</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thing which he does not perceive:-All these utterly and 
absolutely</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">exclude the possibility of false opinion. The only 
cases, if any,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which remain, are the following.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What are they? If you tell me, I may perhaps 
understand</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you better; but at present I am unable to follow you.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. A person may think that some things which he 
knows, or which he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perceives and does not know, are some other things which 
he knows</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and perceives; or that some things which he knows and 
perceives, are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">other things which he knows and perceives.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I understand you less than ever now.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Hear me once more, then:-I, knowing Theodorus, 
and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">remembering in my own mind what sort of person he is, 
and also what</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sort of person Theaetetus is, at one time see them, and 
at another</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">time do not see them, and sometimes I touch them, and at 
another</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">time not, or at one time I may hear them or perceive 
them in some</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">other way, and at another time not perceive them, but 
still I remember</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">them, and know them in my own mind.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then, first of all, I want you to understand that 
a man may</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">or may not perceive sensibly that which he knows.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And that which he does not know will sometimes 
not be perceived</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">by him and sometimes will be perceived and only 
perceived?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. That is also true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>193&nbsp;</b> Soc. See whether you can follow me better 
now: Socrates can</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">recognize Theodorus and Theaetetus, but he sees neither 
of them, nor</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">does he perceive them in any other way; he cannot then 
by any</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">possibility imagine in his own mind that Theaetetus is 
Theodorus. Am I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not right?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. You are quite right.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then that was the first case of which I spoke.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. The second case was, that I, knowing one of you 
and not knowing</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the other, and perceiving neither, can never think him 
whom I know</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to be him whom I do not know.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. In the third case, not knowing and not perceiving 
either of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you, I cannot think that one of you whom I do not know 
is the other</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">whom I do not know. I need not again go over the 
catalogue of excluded</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">cases, in which I cannot form a false opinion about you 
and Theodorus,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">either when I know both or when I am in ignorance of 
both, or when I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">know one and not the other. And the same of perceiving: 
do you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">understand me?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I do.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. The only possibility of erroneous opinion is, 
when knowing</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you and Theodorus, and having on the waxen block the 
impression of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">both of you given as by a seal, but seeing you 
imperfectly and at a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">distance, I try to assign the right impression of memory 
to the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">right visual impression, and to fit this into its own 
print: if I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">succeed, recognition will take place; but if I fad and 
transpose them,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">putting the foot into the wrong shoe-that is to say, 
putting the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">vision of either of you on to the wrong impression, or 
if my mind,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">like the sight in a mirror, which is transferred from 
right to left,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">err by reason of some similar affection, then 
&quot;heterodoxy&quot; and false</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opinion ensues.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, Socrates, you have described the nature 
of opinion with</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wonderful exactness.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Or again, when I know both of you, and perceive 
as well as know</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one of you, but not the other, and my knowledge of him 
does not accord</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">with perception-that was the case put by me just now 
which you did not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">understand</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. No, I did not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I meant to say, that when a person knows and 
perceives one of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you, his knowledge coincides with his perception, he 
will never</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">think him to be some other person, whom he knows and 
perceives, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the knowledge of whom coincides with his perception-for 
that also</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">was a case supposed.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>194</b>&nbsp; Soc. But there was an omission of the 
further case, in which, as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">we now say, false opinion may arise, when knowing both, 
and seeing, or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">having some other sensible perception of both, I fail in 
holding the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">seal over against the corresponding sensation; like a 
bad archer, I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">miss and fall wide of the mark-and this is called 
falsehood.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes; it is rightly so called.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. When, therefore, perception is present to one of 
the seals or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">impressions but not to the other, and the mind fits the 
seal of the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">absent perception on the one which is present, in any 
case of this</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sort the mind is deceived; in a word, if our view is 
sound, there</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">can be no error or deception about things which a man 
does not know</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and has never perceived, but only in things which are 
known and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perceived; in these alone opinion turns and twists 
about, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">becomes alternately true and false;-true when the seals 
and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">impressions of sense meet straight and opposite-false 
when they go</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">awry and crooked.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. And is not that, Socrates, nobly said?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Nobly! yes; but wait a little and hear the 
explanation, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">then you will say so with more reason; for to think 
truly is noble and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to be deceived is base.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Undoubtedly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And the origin of truth and error is as 
follows:-When the wax</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in the soul of any one is deep and abundant, and smooth 
and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perfectly tempered, then the impressions which pass 
through the senses</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and sink into the heart of the soul, as Homer says in a 
parable,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">meaning to indicate the likeness of the soul to wax (Kerh 
Kerhos);</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">these, I say, being pure and clear, and having a 
sufficient depth of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wax, are also lasting, and minds, such as these, easily 
learn and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">easily retain, and are not liable to confusion, but have 
true</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thoughts, for they have plenty of room, and having clear 
impressions</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of things, as we term them, quickly distribute them into 
their</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">proper places on the block. And such men are called 
wise. Do you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">agree?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Entirely.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But when the heart of any one is shaggy-a quality 
which the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">all-wise poet commends, or muddy and of impure wax, or 
very soft, or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">very hard, then there is a corresponding defect in the 
mind -the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">soft are good at learning, but apt to forget; and the 
hard are the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">reverse; the shaggy and rugged and gritty, or those who 
have an</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">admixture of earth or dung in their composition, have 
the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>195</b> impressions indistinct, as also the hard, for 
there is no depth in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">them; and the soft too are indistinct, for their 
impressions are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">easily confused and effaced. Yet greater is the 
indistinctness when</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">they are all jostled together in a little soul, which 
has no room.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">These are the natures which have false opinion; for when 
they see or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">hear or think of anything, they are slow in assigning 
the right</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">objects to the right impressions-in their stupidity they 
confuse them,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and are apt to see and hear and think amiss-and such men 
are said to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be deceived in their knowledge of objects, and ignorant.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. No man, Socrates, can say anything truer than 
that.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then now we may admit the existence of false 
opinion in us?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And of true opinion also?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. We have at length satisfactorily proven beyond a 
doubt there</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are these two sorts of opinion?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Undoubtedly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Alas, Theaetetus, what a tiresome creature is a 
man who is fond</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of talking!</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What makes you say so?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Because I am disheartened at my own stupidity and 
tiresome</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">garrulity; for what other term will describe the habit 
of a man who is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">always arguing on all sides of a question; whose dulness 
cannot be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">convinced, and who will never leave off?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. But what puts you out of heart?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I am not only out of heart, but in positive 
despair; for I do</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not know what to answer if any one were to ask me:-O 
Socrates, have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you indeed discovered that false opinion arises neither 
in the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">comparison of perceptions with one another nor yet in 
thought, but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in union of thought and perception? Yes, I shall say, 
with the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">complacence of one who thinks that he has made a noble 
discovery.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I see no reason why we should be ashamed of 
our</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">demonstration, Socrates.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. He will say: You mean to argue that the man whom 
we only</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">think of and do not see, cannot be confused with the 
horse which we do</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not see or touch, but only think of and do not perceive? 
That I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">believe to be my meaning, I shall reply.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Quite right.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Well, then, he will say, according to that 
argument, the number</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">eleven, which is only thought, never be mistaken for 
twelve, which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is only thought: How would you answer him?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I should say that a mistake may very likely 
arise between</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the eleven or twelve which are seen or handled, but that 
no similar</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">mistake can arise between the eleven and twelve which 
are in the mind.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>196 </b>&nbsp; Soc. Well, but do you think that no one 
ever put before his own mind</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">five and seven, -I do not mean five or seven men or 
horses, but five</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">or seven in the abstract, which, as we say, are recorded 
on the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">waxen block, and in which false opinion is held to be 
impossible;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">did no man ever ask himself how many these numbers make 
when added</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">together, and answer that they are eleven, while another 
thinks that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">they are twelve, or would all agree in thinking and 
saying that they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are twelve?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly not; many would think that they are 
eleven, and in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the higher numbers the chance of error is greater still; 
for I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">assume you to be speaking of numbers in general.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Exactly; and I want you to consider whether this 
does not imply</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that the twelve in the waxen block are supposed to be 
eleven?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, that seems to be the case.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then do we not come back to the old difficulty? 
For he who</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">makes such a mistake does think one thing which he knows 
to be another</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thing which he knows; but this, as we said, was 
impossible, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">afforded an irresistible proof of the non-existence of 
false</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opinion, because otherwise the same person would 
inevitably know and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not know the same thing at the same time.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Most true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then false opinion cannot be explained as a 
confusion of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thought and sense, for in that case we could not have 
been mistaken</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">about pure conceptions of thought; and thus we are 
obliged to say,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">either that false opinion does not exist, or that a man 
may not know</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that which he knows;-which alternative do you prefer?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. It is hard to determine, Socrates.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And yet the argument will scarcely admit of both. 
But, as we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are at our wits' end, suppose that we do a shameless 
thing?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What is it?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Let us attempt to explain the verb &quot;to know.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. And why should that be shameless?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. You seem not to be aware that the whole of our 
discussion</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">from the very beginning has been a search after 
knowledge, of which we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are assumed not to know the nature.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Nay, but I am well aware.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And is it not shameless when we do not know what 
knowledge</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is, to be explaining the verb &quot;to know&quot;? The truth is, 
Theaetetus,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that we have long been infected with logical impurity. 
Thousands of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">times have we repeated the words &quot;we know,&quot; and &quot;do not 
know,&quot; and &quot;we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have or have not science or knowledge,&quot; as if we could 
understand what</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">we are saying to one another, so long as we remain 
ignorant about</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge; and at this moment we are using the words &quot;we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">understand,&quot; &quot;we are ignorant,&quot; as though we could still 
employ them</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">when deprived of knowledge or science.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. But if you avoid these expressions, Socrates, 
how will you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ever argue at all?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>197</b>&nbsp; Soc. I could not, being the man I am. The 
case would be different if</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I were a true hero of dialectic: and O that such an one 
were</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">present! for he would have told us to avoid the use of 
these terms; at</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the same time he would not have spared in you and me the 
faults</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which I have noted. But, seeing that we are no great 
wits, shall I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">venture to say what knowing is? for I think that the 
attempt may be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">worth making.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Then by all means venture, and no one shall 
find fault</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">with you for using the forbidden terms.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. You have heard the common explanation of the verb 
&quot;to know&quot;?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I think so, but I do not remember it at the 
moment.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. They explain the word &quot;to know&quot; as meaning &quot;to 
have knowledge.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I should like to make a slight change, and say 
&quot;to possess&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. How do the two expressions differ?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Perhaps there may be no difference; but still I 
should like you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to hear my view, that you may help me to test it.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I will, if I can.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I should distinguish &quot;having&quot; from &quot;possessing&quot;: 
for example, a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">man may buy and keep under his control a garment which 
he does not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">wear; and then we should say, not that he has, but that 
he possesses</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the garment.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. It would be the correct expression.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Well, may not a man &quot;possess&quot; and yet not &quot;have&quot; 
knowledge in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the sense of which I am speaking? As you may suppose a 
man to have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">caught wild birds -doves or any other birds-and to be 
keeping them</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in an aviary which he has constructed at home; we might 
say of him</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in one sense, that he always has them because he 
possesses them, might</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">we not?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And yet, in another sense, he has none of them; 
but they are in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">his power, and he has got them under his hand in an 
enclosure of his</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">own, and can take and have them whenever he likes;-he 
can catch any</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which he likes, and let the bird go again, and he may do 
so as often</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">as he pleases.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Once more, then, as in what preceded we made a 
sort of waxen</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">figment in the mind, so let us now suppose that in the 
mind of each</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">man there is an aviary of all sorts of birds-some 
flocking together</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">apart from the rest, others in small groups, others 
solitary, flying</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">anywhere and everywhere.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Let us imagine such an aviary-and what is to 
follow?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. We may suppose that the birds are kinds of 
knowledge, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that when we were children, this receptacle was empty; 
whenever a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">man has gotten and detained in the enclosure a kind of 
knowledge, he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">may be said to have learned or discovered the thing 
which is the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">subject of the knowledge: and this is to know.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Granted.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>198</b>&nbsp; Soc. And further, when any one wishes to 
catch any of these</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledges or sciences, and having taken, to hold it, 
and again to let</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">them go, how will he express himself?-will he describe 
the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&quot;catching&quot; of them and the original &quot;possession&quot; in the 
same words?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I will make my meaning clearer by an example:-You admit 
that there</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is an art of arithmetic?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. To be sure.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Conceive this under the form of a hunt after the 
science of odd</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and even in general.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I follow.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Having the use of the art, the arithmetician, if 
I am not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">mistaken, has the conceptions of number under his hand, 
and can</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">transmit them to another.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And when transmitting them he may be said to 
teach them, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">when receiving to learn them, and when receiving to 
learn them, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">when having them in possession in the aforesaid aviary 
he may be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">said to know them.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Exactly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Attend to what follows: must not the perfect 
arithmetician know</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">all numbers, for he has the science of all numbers in 
his mind?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And he can reckon abstract numbers in his head, 
or things about</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">him which are numerable?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Of course he can.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And to reckon is simply to consider how much such 
and such a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">number amounts to?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And so he appears to be searching into something 
which he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knows, as if he did not know it, for we have already 
admitted that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he knows all numbers;-you have heard these perplexing 
questions</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">raised?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I have.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. May we not pursue the image of the doves, and say 
that the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">chase after knowledge is of two kinds? one kind is prior 
to possession</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and for the sake of possession, and the other for the 
sake of taking</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and holding in the hands that which is possessed 
already. And thus,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">when a man has learned and known something long ago, he 
may resume and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">get hold of the knowledge which he has long possessed, 
but has not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">at hand in his mind.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. That was my reason for asking how we ought to 
speak when an</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">arithmetician sets about numbering, or a grammarian 
about reading?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Shall we say, that although he knows, he comes back to 
himself to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">learn what he already knows?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. It would be too absurd, Socrates.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>&nbsp;199 </b>Soc. Shall we say then that he is going to 
read or number what he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">does not know, although we have admitted that he knows 
all letters and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">all numbers?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. That, again, would be an absurdity.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then shall we say that about names we care 
nothing?-any one may</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">twist and turn the words &quot;knowing&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; in any 
way which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he likes, but since we have determined that the 
possession of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge is not the having or using it, we do assert 
that a man</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">cannot not possess that which he possesses; and, 
therefore, in no case</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">can a man not know that which he knows, but he may get a 
false opinion</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">about it; for he may have the knowledge, not of this 
particular thing,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">but of some other;-when the various numbers and forms of 
knowledge are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">flying about in the aviary, and wishing to capture a 
certain sort of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge out of the general store, he takes the wrong 
one by mistake,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that is to say, when he thought eleven to be twelve, he 
got hold of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the ringdove which he had in his mind, when he wanted 
the pigeon.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. A very rational explanation.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But when he catches the one which he wants, then 
he is not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">deceived, and has an opinion of what is, and thus false 
and true</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opinion may exist, and the difficulties which were 
previously raised</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">disappear. I dare say that you agree with me, do you 
not?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And so we are rid of the difficulty of a man's 
not knowing what</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he knows, for we are not driven to the inference that he 
does not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">possess what he possesses, whether he be or be not 
deceived. And yet I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">fear that a greater difficulty is looking in at the 
window.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What is it?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. How can the exchange of one knowledge for another 
ever become</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">false opinion?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What do you mean?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. In the first place, how can a man who has the 
knowledge of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">anything be ignorant of that which he knows, not by 
reason of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ignorance, but by reason of his own knowledge? And, 
again, is it not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">an extreme absurdity that he should suppose another 
thing to be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">this, and this to be another thing;-that, having 
knowledge present</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">with him in his mind, he should still know nothing and 
be ignorant</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of all things?-you might as well argue that ignorance 
may make a man</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">know, and blindness make him see, as that knowledge can 
make him</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ignorant.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Perhaps, Socrates, we may have been wrong in 
making only</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">forms of knowledge our birds: whereas there ought to 
have been forms</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of ignorance as well, flying about together in the mind, 
and then he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">who sought to take one of them might sometimes catch a 
form of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge, and sometimes a form of ignorance; and thus 
he would have a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">false opinion from ignorance, but a true one from 
knowledge, about the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">same thing.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I cannot help praising you, Theaetetus, and yet I 
must beg</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you to reconsider your words. Let us grant what you 
say-then,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">according to you, he who takes ignorance will have a 
false</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opinion-am I right?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>200</b>&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. He will certainly not think that he has a false 
opinion?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Of course not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. He will think that his opinion is true, and he 
will fancy</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that he knows the things about which he has been 
deceived?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then he will think that he has captured knowledge 
and not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ignorance?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And thus, after going a long way round, we are 
once more face</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to face with our original difficulty. The hero of 
dialectic will</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">retort upon us:-&quot;O my excellent friends, he will say, 
laughing, if a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">man knows the form of ignorance and the form of 
knowledge, can he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">think that one of them which he knows is the other which 
he knows? or,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">if he knows neither of them, can he think that the one 
which he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knows not is another which he knows not? or, if he knows 
one and not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the other, can he think the one which he knows to be the 
one which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">he does not know? or the one which he does not know to 
be the one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which he knows? or will you tell me that there are other 
forms of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge which distinguish the right and wrong birds, 
and which the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">owner keeps in some other aviaries or graven on waxen 
blocks according</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to your foolish images, and which he may be said to know 
while he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">possesses them, even though he have them not at hand in 
his mind?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">And thus, in a perpetual circle, you will be compelled 
to go round and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">round, and you will make no progress.&quot; What are we to 
say in reply,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theaetetus?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Indeed, Socrates, I do not know what we are to 
say.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Are not his reproaches just, and does not the 
argument truly</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">show that we are wrong in seeking for false opinion 
until we know what</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge is; that must be first ascertained; then, the 
nature of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">false opinion?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I cannot but agree with you, Socrates, so far 
as we have yet</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">gone.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then, once more, what shall we say that knowledge 
is?-for we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are not going to lose heart as yet.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly, I shall not lose heart, if you do 
not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. What definition will be most consistent with our 
former views?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I cannot think of any but our old one, 
Socrates.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. What was it?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Knowledge was said by us to be true opinion; 
and true</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opinion is surely unerring, and the results which follow 
from it are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">all noble and good.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. He who led the way into the river, Theaetetus, 
said &quot;The</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">experiment will show&quot;; and perhaps if we go forward in 
the search,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">we may stumble upon the thing which we are looking for; 
but if we stay</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">where we are, nothing will come to light.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>201&nbsp;</b> Theaet. Very true; let us go forward and 
try.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. The trail soon comes to an end, for a whole 
profession is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">against us.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. How is that, and what profession do you mean?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. The profession of the great wise ones who are 
called orators</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and lawyers; for these persuade men by their art and 
make them think</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">whatever they like, but they do not teach them. Do you 
imagine that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">there are any teachers in the world so clever as to be 
able to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">convince others of the truth about acts of robbery or 
violence, of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which they were not eyewitnesses, while a little water 
is flowing in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the clepsydra?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly not, they can only persuade them.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And would you not say that persuading them is 
making them</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have an opinion?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. To be sure.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. When, therefore, judges are justly persuaded 
about matters</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which you can know only by seeing them, and not in any 
other way,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and when thus judging of them from report they attain a 
true opinion</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">about them, they judge without knowledge and yet are 
rightly</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">persuaded, if they have judged well.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And yet, O my friend, if true opinion in law 
courts and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge are the same, the perfect judge could not have 
judged</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">rightly without knowledge; and therefore I must infer 
that they are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not the same.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. That is a distinction, Socrates, which I have 
heard made</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">by some one else, but I had forgotten it. He said that 
true opinion,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">combined with reason, was knowledge, but that the 
opinion which had no</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">reason was out of the sphere of knowledge; and that 
things of which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">there is no rational account are not knowable-such was 
the singular</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">expression which he used-and that things which have a 
reason or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">explanation are knowable.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Excellent; but then, how did he distinguish 
between things</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which are and are not &quot;knowable&quot;? I wish that you would 
repeat to me</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">what he said, and then I shall know whether you and I 
have heard the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">same tale.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I do not know whether I can recall it; but if 
another person</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">would tell me, I think that I could follow him.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Let me give you, then, a dream in return for a 
dream:-Methought</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that I too had a dream, and I heard in my dream that the 
primeval</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">letters or elements out of which you and I and all other 
things are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>202 </b>compounded, have no reason or explanation; 
you can only name them, but</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">no predicate can be either affirmed or denied of them, 
for in the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one case existence, in the other non-existence is 
already implied,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">neither of which must be added, if you mean to speak of 
this or that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thing by itself alone. It should not be called itself, 
or that, or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">each, or alone, or this, or the like; for these go about 
everywhere</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and are applied to all things, but are distinct from 
them; whereas, if</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the first elements could be described, and had a 
definition of their</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">own, they would be spoken of apart from all else. But 
none of these</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">primeval elements can be defined; they can only be 
named, for they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have nothing but a name, and the things which are 
compounded of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">them, as they are complex, are expressed by a 
combination of names,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">for the combination of names is the essence of a 
definition. Thus,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">then, the elements or letters are only objects of 
perception, and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">cannot be defined or known; but the syllables or 
combinations of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">them are known and expressed, and are apprehended by 
true opinion.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">When, therefore, any one forms the true opinion of 
anything without</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">rational explanation, you may say that his mind is truly 
exercised,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">but has no knowledge; for he who cannot give and receive 
a reason</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">for a thing, has no knowledge of that thing; but when he 
adds rational</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">explanation, then, he is perfected in knowledge and may 
be all that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">I have been denying of him. Was that the form in which 
the dream</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">appeared to you?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Precisely.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And you allow and maintain that true opinion, 
combined with</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">definition or rational explanation, is knowledge?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Exactly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then may we assume, Theaetetus, that to-day, and 
in this casual</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">manner, we have found a truth which in former times many 
wise men have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">grown old and have not found?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. At any rate, Socrates, I am satisfied with the 
present</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">statement.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Which is probably correct-for how can there be 
knowledge</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">apart from definition and true opinion? And yet there is 
one point</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">in what has been said which does not quite satisfy me.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What was it?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. What might seem to be the most ingenious notion 
of all:-That</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the elements or letters are unknown, but the combination 
or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">syllables known.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. And was that wrong?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. We shall soon know; for we have as hostages the 
instances which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the author of the argument himself used.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What hostages?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;Soc. The letters, which are the clements; and the 
syllables, which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are the combinations;-he reasoned, did he not, from the 
letters of the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">alphabet?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes; he did.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>203</b>&nbsp; Soc. Let us take them and put them to the 
test, or rather, test</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ourselves:-What was the way in which we learned letters? 
and, first of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">all, are we right in saying that syllables have a 
definition, but that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">letters have no definition?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I think so.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I think so too; for, suppose that some one asks 
you to spell</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the first syllable of my name:-Theaetetus, he says, what 
is SO?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I should reply S and O.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. That is the definition which you would give of 
the syllable?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I should.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I wish that you would give me a similar 
definition of the S.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;Theaet. But how can any one, Socrates, tell the 
elements of an</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">element? I can only reply, that S is a consonant, a mere 
noise, as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of the tongue hissing; B, and most other letters, again, 
are neither</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">vowel-sounds nor noises. Thus letters may be most truly 
said to be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">undefined; for even the most distinct of them, which are 
the seven</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">vowels, have a sound only, but no definition at all.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then, I suppose, my friend, that we have been so 
far right in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">our idea about knowledge?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes; I think that we have.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Well, but have we been right in maintaining that 
the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">syllables can be known, but not the letters?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I think so.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And do we mean by a syllable two letters, or if 
there are more,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">all of them, or a single idea which arises out of the 
combination of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">them?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I should say that we mean all the letters.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Take the case of the two letters S and O, which 
form the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">first syllable of my own name; must not he who knows the 
syllable,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">know both of them?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. He knows, that is, the S and O?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But can he be ignorant of either singly and yet 
know both</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">together?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Such a supposition, Socrates, is monstrous and 
unmeaning.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But if he cannot know both without knowing each, 
then if he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is ever to know the syllable, he must know the letters 
first; and thus</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the fine theory has again taken wings and departed.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, with wonderful celerity.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Yes, we did not keep watch properly. Perhaps we 
ought to have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">maintained that a syllable is not the letters, but 
rather one single</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">idea framed out of them, having a separate form distinct 
from them.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very true; and a more likely notion than the 
other.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Take care; let us not be cowards and betray a 
great and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">imposing theory.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. No, indeed.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>&nbsp;204</b>&nbsp; Soc. Let us assume then, as we now 
say, that the syllable is a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">simple form arising out of the several combinations of 
harmonious</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">elements-of letters or of any other elements.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very good.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And it must have no parts.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Why?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Because that which has parts must be a whole of 
all the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">parts. Or would you say that a whole, although formed 
out of the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">parts, is a single notion different from all the parts?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I should.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And would you say that all and the whole are the 
same, or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">different?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I am not certain; but, as you like me to 
answer at once, I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">shall hazard the reply, that they are different.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. I approve of your readiness, Theaetetus, but I 
must take time</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to think whether I equally approve of your answer.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes; the answer is the point.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. According to this new view, the whole is supposed 
to differ</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">from all?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Well, but is there any difference between all [in 
the plural]</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and the all [in the singular]? Take the case of 
number:-When we say</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one, two, three, four, five, six; or when we say twice 
three, or three</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">times two, or four and two, or three and two and one, 
are we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">speaking of the same or of different numbers?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Of the same.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. That is of six?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And in each form of expression we spoke of all 
the six?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Again, in speaking of all [in the plural] is 
there not one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thing which we express?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Of course there is.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And that is six?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then in predicating the word &quot;all&quot; of things 
measured by</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">number, we predicate at the same time a singular and a 
plural?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Clearly we do.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Again, the number of the acre and the acre are 
the same; are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">they not?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And the number of the stadium in like manner is 
the stadium?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And the army is the number of the army; and in 
all similar</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">cases, the entire number of anything is the entire 
thing?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And the number of each is the parts of each?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Exactly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then as many things as have parts are made up of 
parts?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But all the parts are admitted to be the all, if 
the entire</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">number is the all?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then the whole is not made up of parts, for it 
would be the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">all, if consisting of all the parts?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. That is the inference.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But is a part a part of anything but the whole?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes, of the all.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>205&nbsp;</b> Soc. You make a valiant defence, Theaetetus. 
And yet is not the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">all that of which nothing is wanting?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And is not a whole likewise that from which 
nothing is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">absent? but that from which anything is absent is 
neither a whole</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">nor all;-if wanting in anything, both equally lose their 
entirety of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">nature.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I now think that there is no difference 
between a whole</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and all.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But were we not saying that when a thing has 
parts, all the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">parts will be a whole and all?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then, as I was saying before, must not the 
alternative be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that either the syllable is not the letters, and then 
the letters</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are not parts of the syllable, or that the syllable will 
be the same</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">with the letters, and will therefore be equally known 
with them?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. You are right.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And, in order to avoid this, we suppose it to be 
different from</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">them?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But if letters are not parts of syllables, can 
you tell me of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">any other parts of syllables, which are not letters?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. No, indeed, Socrates; for if I admit the 
existence of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">parts in a syllable, it would be ridiculous in me to 
give up letters</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and seek for other parts.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Quite true, Theaetetus, and therefore, according 
to our present</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">view, a syllable must surely be some indivisible form?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But do you remember, my friend, that only a 
little while ago we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">admitted and approved the statement, that of the first 
elements out of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which all other things are compounded there could be no 
definition,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">because each of them when taken by itself is 
uncompounded; nor can one</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">rightly attribute to them the words &quot;being&quot; or &quot;this,&quot; 
because they</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">are alien and inappropriate words, and for this reason 
the letters</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">or clements were indefinable and unknown?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I remember.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And is not this also the reason why they are 
simple and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">indivisible? I can see no other.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. No other reason can be given.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then is not the syllable in the same case as the 
elements or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">letters, if it has no parts and is one form?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. To be sure.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. If, then, a syllable is a whole, and has many 
parts or letters,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the letters as well as the syllable must be intelligible 
and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">expressible, since all the parts are acknowledged to be 
the same as</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the whole?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But if it be one and indivisible, then the 
syllables and the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">letters are alike undefined and unknown, and for the 
same reason?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I cannot deny that.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. We cannot, therefore, agree in the opinion of him 
who says that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the syllable can be known and expressed, but not the 
letters.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly not; if we may trust the argument.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>206&nbsp;</b> Soc. Well, but will you not be equally 
inclined to, disagree with</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">him, when you remember your own experience in learning 
to read?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What experience?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Why, that in learning you were kept trying to 
distinguish the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">separate letters both by the eye and by the car, in 
order that, when</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you heard them spoken or saw them written, you might not 
be confused</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">by their position.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And is the education of the harp-player complete 
unless he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">can tell what string answers to a particular note; the 
notes, as every</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">one would allow, are the elements or letters of music?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Exactly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then, if we argue from the letters and syllables 
which we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">know to other simples and compounds, we shall say that 
the letters</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">or simple clements as a class are much more certainly 
known than the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">syllables, and much more indispensable to a perfect 
knowledge of any</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">subject; and if some one says that the syllable is known 
and the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">letter unknown, we shall consider that either 
intentionally or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">unintentionally he is talking nonsense?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Exactly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And there might be given other proofs of this 
belief, if I am</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not mistaken. But do not let us in looking for them lose 
sight of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the question before us, which is the meaning of the 
statement, that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">right opinion with rational definition or explanation is 
the most</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">perfect form of knowledge.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. We must not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Well, and what is the meaning of the term 
&quot;explanation&quot;? I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">think that we have a choice of three meanings.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What are they?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. In the first place, the meaning may be, 
manifesting one's</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thought by the voice with verbs and nouns, imaging an 
opinion in the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">stream which flows from the lips, as in a mirror or 
water. Does not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">explanation appear to be of this nature?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly; he who so manifests his thought, is 
said to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">explain himself.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And every one who is not born deaf or dumb is 
able sooner or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">later to manifest what he thinks of anything; and if so, 
all those who</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have a right opinion about anything will also have right</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">explanation; nor will right opinion be anywhere found to 
exist apart</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">from knowledge.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>207</b>&nbsp; Soc. Let us not, therefore, hastily charge 
him who gave this account</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of knowledge with uttering an unmeaning word; for 
perhaps he only</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">intended to say, that when a person was asked what was 
the nature of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">anything, he should be able to answer his questioner by 
giving the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">clements of the thing.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. As for example, Socrates...?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. As, for example, when Hesiod says that a waggon 
is made up of a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">hundred planks. Now, neither you nor I could describe 
all of them</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">individually; but if any one asked what is a waggon, we 
should be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">content to answer, that a waggon consists of wheels, 
axle, body, rims,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">yoke.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And our opponent will probably laugh at us, just 
as he would if</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">we professed to be grammarians and to give a grammatical 
account of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the name of Theaetetus, and yet could only tell the 
syllables and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">not the letters of your name-that would be true opinion, 
and not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge; for knowledge, as has been already remarked, 
is not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">attained until, combined with true opinion, there is an 
enumeration of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the elements out of which is composed.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. In the same general way, we might also have true 
opinion</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">about a waggon; but he who can describe its essence by 
an</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">enumeration of the hundred planks, adds rational 
explanation to true</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opinion, and instead of opinion has art and knowledge of 
the nature of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">a waggon, in that he attains to the whole through the 
elements.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. And do. you not agree in that view, Socrates?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. If you do, my friend; but I want to know first, 
whether you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">admit the resolution of all things into their elements 
to be a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">rational explanation of them, and the consideration of 
them in</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">syllables or larger combinations of them to be 
irrational-is this your</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">view?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Precisely.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Well, and do you conceive that a man has 
knowledge of any</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">element who at one time affirms and at another time 
denies that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">clement of something, or thinks that. the same thing is 
composed of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">different elements at different times?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Assuredly not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And do you not remember that in your case and in 
of others this</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">often occurred in the process of learning to read?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. You mean that I mistook the letters and 
misspelt the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">syllables?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. To be sure; I perfectly remember, and I am 
very far from</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">supposing that they who are in this condition, have 
knowledge.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. When a person, at the time of learning writes the 
name of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theaetetus, and thinks that he ought to write and does 
write Th and e;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>208</b> but, again meaning to write the name of 
Theododorus, thinks that he</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ought to write and does write T and e-can we suppose 
that he knows the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">first syllables of your two names?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. We have already admitted that such a one has 
not yet</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">attained knowledge.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And in like manner be may enumerate without 
knowing them the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">second and third and fourth syllables of your name?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. He may.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And in that case, when he knows the order of the 
letters and</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">can write them out correctly, he has right opinion?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But although we admit that he has right opinion, 
he will</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">still be without knowledge?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And yet he will have explanations, as well as 
right opinion,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">for he knew the order of the letters when he wrote; and 
this we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">admit be explanation.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then, my friend, there is such a thing as right 
opinion</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">united with definition or explanation, which does not as 
yet attain to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the exactness of knowledge.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. It would seem so.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And what we fancied to be a perfect definition of 
knowledge</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">is a dream only. But perhaps we had better not say so as 
yet, for were</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">there not three explanations of knowledge, one of which 
must, as we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">said, be adopted by him who maintains knowledge to be 
true opinion</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">combined with rational explanation? And very likely 
there may be found</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">some one who will not prefer this but the third.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. You are quite right; there is still one 
remaining. The first</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">was the image or expression of the mind in speech; the 
second, which</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">has just been mentioned, is a way of reaching the whole 
by an</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">enumeration of the elements. But what is; the third 
definition?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. There is, further, the popular notion of telling 
the mark or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sign of difference which distinguishes the thing in 
question from</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">all others.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Can you give me any example of such a 
definition?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. As, for example, in the case of the sun, I think 
that you would</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be contented with the statement that the sun is, the 
brightest of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the heavenly bodies which revolve about the earth.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Understand why:-the reason is, as I was just now 
saying, that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">if you get at the difference and distinguishing 
characteristic of each</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">thing, then, as many persons affirm, you will get at the 
definition or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">explanation of it; but while you lay hold only of the 
common and not</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of the characteristic notion, you will only have the 
definition of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">those things to which this common quality belongs.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I understand you, and your account of 
definition is in my</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">judgment correct.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But he, who having right opinion about anything, 
can find out</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the difference which distinguishes it from other things 
will know that</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of which before he had only an opinion.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes; that is what we are maintaining.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Nevertheless, Theaetetus, on a nearer view, I 
find myself quite</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">disappointed; the picture, which at a distance was not 
so bad, has now</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">become altogether unintelligible.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. What do you mean?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>&nbsp;209 </b>&nbsp;Soc. I will endeavour to explain: I 
will suppose myself to have true</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">opinion of you, and if to this I add your definition, 
then I have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge, but if not, opinion only.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. The definition was assumed to be the 
interpretation of your</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">difference.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But when I had only opinion, I had no conception 
of your</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">distinguishing characteristics.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I suppose not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then I must have conceived of some general or 
common nature</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which no more belonged to you than to another.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Tell me, now-How in that case could I have formed 
a judgment of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">you any more than of any one else? Suppose that I 
imagine Theaetetus</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to be a man who has nose, eyes, and mouth, and every 
other member</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">complete; how would that enable me to distinguish 
Theaetetus from</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Theodorus, or from some outer barbarian?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. How could it?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Or if I had further conceived of you, not only as 
having nose</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and eyes, but as having a snub nose and prominent eyes, 
should I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have any more notion of you than of myself and others 
who resemble me?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Certainly not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Surely I can have no conception of Theaetetus 
until your</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">snub-nosedness has left an impression on my mind 
different from the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">snub-nosedness of all others whom I have ever seen, and 
until your</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">other peculiarities have a like distinctness; and so 
when I meet you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">tomorrow the right opinion will be re-called?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Most true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. Then right opinion implies the perception of 
differences?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. What, then, shall we say of adding reason or 
explanation to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">right opinion? If the meaning is, that we should form an 
opinion of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the way in which something differs from another thing, 
the proposal is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">ridiculous.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. How so?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. We are supposed to acquire a right opinion of the 
differences</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">which distinguish one thing from another when we have 
already a</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">right opinion of them, and so we go round and round:-the 
revolution of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the scytal, or pestle, or any other rotatory machine, in 
the same</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">circles, is as nothing compared with such a requirement; 
and we may be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">truly described as the blind directing the blind; for to 
add those</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">things which we already have, in order that we may learn 
what we</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">already think, is like a soul utterly benighted.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Tell me; what were you going to say just now, 
when you asked</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the question?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b>210&nbsp;</b> Soc. If, my boy, the argument, in speaking 
of adding the definition,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">had used the word to &quot;know,&quot; and not merely &quot;have an 
opinion&quot; of the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">difference, this which is the most promising of all the 
definitions of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge would have come to a pretty end, for to know 
is surely to</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">acquire knowledge.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. True.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And so, when the question is asked, What is 
knowledge? this</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">fair argument will answer &quot;Right opinion with 
knowledge,&quot;-knowledge,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">that is, of difference, for this, as the said argument 
maintains, is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">adding the definition.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. That seems to be true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But how utterly foolish, when we are asking what 
is</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">knowledge, that the reply should only be, right opinion 
with knowledge</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">of difference or of anything! And so, Theaetetus, 
knowledge is neither</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">sensation nor true opinion, nor yet definition and 
explanation</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">accompanying and added to true opinion?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I suppose not.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And are you still in labour and travail, my dear 
friend, or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">have you brought all that you have to say about 
knowledge to the</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">birth?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. I am sure, Socrates, that you have elicited 
from me a good</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">deal more than ever was in me.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. And does not my art show that you have brought 
forth wind,</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">and that the offspring of your brain are not worth 
bringing up?</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Soc. But if, Theaetetus, you should ever conceive 
afresh, you will</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be all the better for the present investigation, and if 
not, you</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">will be soberer and humbler and gentler to other men, 
and will be</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">too modest to fancy that you know what you do not know. 
These are</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the limits of my art; I can no further go, nor do I know 
aught of</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">the things which great and famous men know or have known 
in this or</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">former ages. The office of a midwife I, like my mother, 
have</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">received from God; she delivered women, I deliver men; 
but they must</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">be young and noble and fair.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; And now I have to go to the porch of the King Archon, 
where I am</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">to meet Meletus and his indictment. To-morrow morning, 
Theodorus, I</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">shall hope to see you again at this place.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -THE END-</p>
