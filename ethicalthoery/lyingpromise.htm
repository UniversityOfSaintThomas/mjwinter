<p align="center">FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE METAPHYSIC OF MORALS</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;by Immanuel Kant</p>
<p align="center">translated by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott</p>
<p align="left">There is therefore but one categorical imperative, namely,
this: <i>Act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will
that it should become a universal law.</i>
</p>
<p align="left">.......2. Another finds himself forced by necessity to borrow 
money. He knows that he will not be able to repay it, but sees also that nothing 
will be lent to him unless he promises stoutly to repay it in a definite time. 
He desires to make this promise, but he has still so much conscience as to ask 
himself: &quot;Is it not unlawful and inconsistent with duty to get out of a 
difficulty in this way?&quot;
<br>Suppose however that he resolves to do so: then the maxim of his action
would be expressed thus: "When I think myself in want of money, I will
borrow money and promise to repay it, although I know that I never can
do so." Now this principle of self-love or of one's own advantage may perhaps
be consistent with my whole future welfare; but the question now is, "Is
it right?" I change then the suggestion of self-love into a universal law,
and state the question thus: "How would it be if my maxim were a universal
law?" Then I see at once that it could never hold as a universal law of
nature, but would necessarily contradict itself. For supposing it to be
a universal law that everyone when he thinks himself in a difficulty should
be able to promise whatever he pleases, with the purpose of not keeping
his promise, the promise itself would become impossible, as well as the
end that one might have in view in it, since no one would consider that
anything was promised to him, but would ridicule all such
<br>statements as vain pretences.

<p align="left">......Secondly, as regards necessary duties, or those of strict 
obligation, towards others: He who is thinking of making a lying
<br>promise to others will see at once that he would be using another man
merely as a mean, without the latter containing at the same time the end
in himself. For he whom I propose by such a promise to use for my own purposes
cannot possibly assent to my mode of acting towards him and, therefore,
cannot himself contain the end of this action.
<br>This violation of the principle of humanity in other men is more obvious
if we take in examples of attacks on the freedom and
<br>property of others. For then it is clear that he who transgresses the
rights of men intends to use the person of others merely as a
<br>means, without considering that as rational beings they ought always
to be esteemed also as ends, that is, as beings who must be capable of
containing in themselves the end of the very same action.
