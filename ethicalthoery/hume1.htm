    <p><em>I think it proper to inform the public, that tho' this be a third
    volume of the </em>Treatise of Human Nature,<em> yet 'tis in some measure
    independent of the other two, and requires not that the reader shou'd enter
    into all the abstract reasonings contain'd in them. I am hopeful it may be
    understood by ordinary readers, with as little attention as is usually given
    to any books of reasoning. It must only be observ'd, that I continue to make
    use of the terms, </em>impressions <em>and </em>ideas<em>, in the same sense
    as formerly; and that by impressions I mean our stronger perceptions, such
    as our sensations, affections and sentiments; and by ideas the fainter
    perceptions, or the copies of these in the memory and imagination.</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Moral distinctions not deriv'd from reason</em></p>
<p>There is an inconvenience which attends all abstruse reasoning. that it may
silence, without convincing an antagonist, and requires the same intense study
to make us sensible of its force, that was at first requisite for its invention.
When we leave our closet, and engage in the common affairs of life, its
conclusions seem to vanish, like the phantoms of the night on the appearance of
the morning; and `tis difficult for us to retain even that conviction, which we
had attain'd with difficulty. This is still more conspicuous in a long chain of
reasoning, where we must preserve to the end the evidence of the first
propositions, and where we often lose sight of ail the most receiv'd maxims,
either of philosophy or common life. I am not, however, without hopes, that the
present system of philosophy will acquire new force as it advances; and that our
reasonings concerning morals will corroborate whatever has been said concerning
the <em>understanding</em> and the <em>passions</em>. Morality is a subject that
interests us above all others: We fancy the peace of society to be at stake in
every decision concerning it; and `tis evident, that this concern must make our
speculations appear more real and solid, than where the subject is, in a great
measure, indifferent to us. What affects us, we conclude can never be a chimera;
and as our passion is engag'd on the one side or the other, we naturally think
that the question lies within human comprehension; which, in other cases of this
nature, we are apt to entertain some doubt of. Without this advantage I never
should have ventur'd upon a third volume of such abstruse philosophy, in an age,
wherein the greatest part of men seem agreed to convert reading into an
amusement, and to reject every thing that requires any considerable degree of
attention to be comprehended.</p>
<p>It has been observ'd, that nothing is ever present to the mind but its
perceptions; and that all the actions of seeing, hearing, judging, loving,
hating, and thinking, fall under this denomination. The mind can never exert
itself in any action, which we may not comprehend under the term of perception;
and consequently that term is no less applicable to those judgments, by which we
distinguish moral good and evil, than to every other operation of the mind. To
approve of one character, to condemn another, are only so many different
perceptions.</p>
<p>Now as perceptions resolve themselves into two kinds, viz. impressions and
ideas, this distinction gives rise to a question, with which we shall open up
our present enquiry concerning morals. <em>Whether `tis by means of our ideas or
impressions we distinguish betwixt vice and virtue, and pronounce an action
blameable or praiseworthy</em>? This will immediately cut off all loose
discourses and declamations, and reduce us to something precise and exact on the
present subject.</p>
<p>Those who affirm that virtue is nothing but a conformity to reason; that
there are eternal fitnesses and unfitnesses of things, which are the same to
every rational being that considers them; that the immutable measures of right
and wrong impose an obligation, not only on human creatures, but also on the
Deity himself: All these systems concur in the opinion, that morality, like
truth, is discern'd merely by ideas, and by their juxta-position and comparison.
In order, therefore, to judge of these systems, we need only consider, whether
it be possible, from reason alone, to distinguish betwixt moral good and evil,
or whether there must concur some other principles to enable us to make that
distinction,</p>
<p>If morality had naturally no influence on human passions and actions, `twere
in vain to take such pains to inculcate it; and nothing wou'd be more fruitless
than that multitude of rules and precepts, with which all moralists abound.
Philosophy is commonly divided into speculative and practical; and as morality
is always comprehended under the latter division, `tis supposed to influence our
passions and actions, and to go beyond the calm and indolent judgments of the
understanding. And this is confirm'd by common experience, which informs us,
that men are often govern'd by their duties, and are deter'd from some actions
by the opinion of injustice, and impell'd to others by that of obligation.</p>
<p>Since morals, therefore, have an influence on the actions and affections, it
follows, that they cannot be deriv'd from reason; and that because reason alone,
as we have already prov'd, can never have any such influence. Morals excite
passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent
in this particular. The rules of morality. therefore, are not conclusions of our
reason.</p>
<p>No one, I believe, will deny the justness of this inference; nor is there any
other means of evading it, than by denying that principle, on which it is
founded. As long as it is allow'd, that reason has no influence on our passions
and action., `tis in vain to pretend, that morality is discover'd only by a
deduction of reason. An active principle can never be founded on an inactive;
and if reason be inactive in itself, it must remain so in all its shapes and
appearances, whether it exerts itself in natural or moral subjects, whether it
considers the powers of external bodies, or the actions of rational beings.</p>
<p>It would be tedious to repeat all the arguments, by which I have prov'd,<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
that reason is perfectly inert, and can never either prevent or produce any
action or affection. `Twill be easy to recollect what has been said upon that
subject. I shall only recal on this occasion one of these arguments, which I
shall endeavour to render still more conclusive, and more applicable to the
present subject.</p>
<p>Reason is the discovery of truth or falshood. Truth or falshood consists in
an agreement or disagreement either to the real relations of ideas, or to real
existence and matter of fact. Whatever, therefore, is not susceptible of this
agreement or disagreement, is incapable of being true or false, and can never be
an object of our reason. Now `tis evident our passions, volitions, and actions,
are not susceptible of any such agreement or disagreement; being original facts
and realities, compleat in themselves, and implying no reference to other
passions, volitions, and actions. Tis impossible, therefore, they can be
pronounced either true or false, and be either contrary or conformable to
reason.</p>
<p>This argument is of double advantage to our present purpose. For it proves <em>directly</em>,
that actions do not derive their merit from a conformity to reason, nor their
blame from a contrariety to it; and it proves the same truth more <em>indirectly</em>,
by shewing us, that as reason can never immediately prevent or produce any
action by contradicting or approving of it, it cannot be the source of moral
good and evil, which are found to have that influence. Actions may be laudable
or blameable; but they cannot be reasonable: Laudable or blameable, therefore,
are not the same with reasonable or unreasonable. The merit and demerit of
actions frequently contradict, and sometimes controul our natural propensities.
But reason has no such influence. Moral distinctions, therefore, are not the
offspring of reason. Reason is wholly inactive, and can never be the source of
so active a principle as conscience, or a sense of morals.</p>
<p>But perhaps it may be said, that tho' no will or action can be immediately
contradictory to reason, yet we may find such a contradiction in some of the
attendants of the action, that is, in its causes or effects. The action may
cause a judgment, or may be obliquely caus'd by one, when the judgment concurs
with a passion; and by an abusive way of speaking, which philosophy will scarce
allow of, the same contrariety may, upon that account, be ascrib'd to the
action. How far this truth or faishood may be the source of morals, `twill now
be proper to consider.</p>
<p>It has been observ'd, that reason, in a strict and philosophical sense, can
have influence on our conduct only after two ways: Either when it excites a
passion by informing us of the existence of something which is a proper object
of it; or when it discovers the connexion of causes and effects, so as to afford
us means of exerting any passion. These are the only kinds of judgment, which
can accompany our actions, or can be said to produce them in any manner; and it
must be allow'd, that these judgments may often be false and erroneous. A person
may be affected with passion, by supposing a pain or pleasure to lie in an
object, which has no tendency to produce either of these sensations, or which
produces the contrary to what is imagin'd. A person may also take false measures
for the attaining his end, and may retard, by his foolish conduct, instead of
forwarding the execution of any project. These false judgments may be thought to
affect the passions and actions, which are connected with them, and may be said
to render them unreasonable, in a figurative and improper way of speaking. But
tho' this be acknowledg'd, `tis easy to observe, that these errors are so far
from being the source of all immorality, that they are commonly very innocent,
and draw no manner of guilt upon the person who is so unfortunate as to fail
into them. They extend not beyond a mistake of fact, which moralists have not
generally suppos'd criminal, as being perfectly involuntary. I am more to be
lamented than blam'd, if I am mistaken with regard to the influence of objects
in producing pain or pleasure, or if I know not the proper means of satisfying
my desires. No one can ever regard such errors as a defect in my moral
character. A fruit, for instance, that is really disagreeable, appears to me at
a distance, and thro' mistake I fancy it to be pleasant and delicious. Here is
one error. I choose certain means of reaching this fruit, which are not proper
for my end. Here is a second error; nor is there any third one, which can ever
possibly enter into our reasonings concerning actions. I ask, therefore, if a
man, in this situation, and guilty of these two errors, is to be regarded as
vicious and criminal, however unavoidable they might have been? Or if it be
possible to imagine, that such errors are the sources of all immorality?</p>
<p>And here it may be proper to observe, that if moral distinctions be deriv'd
from the truth or falshood of those judgments, they must take place wherever we
form the judgments; nor will there be any difference, whether the question be
concerning an apple or a kingdom, or whether the error be avoidable or
unavoidable. For as the very essence of morality is suppos'd to consist in an
agreement or disagreement to reason, the other circumstances are entirely
arbitrary, and can never either bestow on any action the character of virtuous
or vicious, or deprive it of that character. To which we may add, that this
agreement or disagreement, not admitting of degrees, all virtues and vices wou'd
of course be equal.</p>
<p>Shou'd it be pretended, that tho' a mistake of fact be not criminal, yet a
mistake of right often is; and that this may be the source of immorality: I
would answer, that `tis impossible such a mistake can ever be the original
source of immorality, since it supposes a real right and wrong; that is, a real
distinction in morals, independent of these judgments. A mistake, therefore, of
right may become a species of immorality; but `tis only a secondary one, and is
founded on some other, antecedent to it.</p>
<p>As to those judgments which are the effects of our actions, and which, when
false, give occasion to pronounce the actions contrary to truth and reason; we
may observe, that our actions never cause any judgment, either true or false, in
ourselves, and that `tis only on others they have such an influence. `Tis
certain, that an action, on many occasions, may give rise to false conclusions
in others; and that a person, who thro' a window sees any lewd behaviour of mine
with my neighbour's wife, may be so simple as to imagine she is certainly my
own. In this respect my action resembles somewhat a lye or falshood; only with
this difference, which is material, that I perform not the action with any
intention of giving rise to a false judgment in another, but merely to satisfy
my lust and passion. It causes, however, a mistake and false judgment by
accident; and the falshood of its effects may be ascribed, by some odd
figurative way of speaking, to the action itself. But still I can see no pretext
of reason for asserting, that the tendency to cause such an error is the first
spring or original source of all immorality.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus upon the whole, `tis impossible, that the distinction betwixt moral good
and evil, can be made to reason; since that distinction has an influence upon
our actions, of which reason alone is incapable. Reason and judgment may,
indeed, be the mediate cause of an action, by prompting, or by directing a
passion: But it is not pretended, that a judgment of this kind, either in its
truth or falshood, is attended with virtue or vice. And as to the judgments,
which are caused by our judgments, they can still less bestow those moral
qualities on the actions, which are their causes.</p>
<p>But to be more particular, and to shew, that those eternal immutable
fitnesses and unfitnesses of things cannot be defended by sound philosophy, we
may weigh the following considerations.</p>
<p>If the thought and understanding were alone capable of fixing the boundaries
of right and wrong, the character of virtuous and vicious either must lie in
some relations of objects, or must be a matter of fact, which is discovered by
our reasoning. This consequence is evident. As the operations of human
understanding divide themselves into two kinds, the comparing of ideas, and the
inferring of matter of fact; were virtue discover'd by the understanding; it
must be an object of one of these operations, nor is there any third operation
of the understanding. which can discover it. There has been an opinion very
industriously propagated by certain philosophers, that morality is susceptible
of demonstration; and tho' no one has ever been able to advance a single step in
those demonstrations; yet `tis taken for granted, that this science may be
brought to an equal certainty with geometry or algebra. Upon this supposition.
vice and virtue must consist in some relations; since `tis allow'd on all hands,
that no matter of fact is capable of being demonstrated. Let us, therefore,
begin with examining this hypothesis, and endeavour, if possible, to fix those
moral qualities, which have been so long the objects of our fruitless
researches. Point out distinctly the relations, which constitute morality or
obligation, that we may know wherein they consist, and after what manner we must
judge of them.</p>
<p>If you assert, that vice and virtue consist in relations susceptible of
certainty and demonstration, you must confine yourself to those four relations,
which alone admit of that degree of evidence; and in that case you run into
absurdities, from which you will never be able to extricate yourself. For as you
make the very essence of morality to lie in the relations, and as there is no
one of these relations but what is applicable, not only to an irrational, but
also to an inanimate object; it follows, that even such objects must be
susceptible of merit or demerit. <em>Resemblance</em>, <em>contrariety</em>, <em>degrees
in quality</em>, and <em>proportions in quantity and number</em>; all these
relations belong as properly to matter, as to our actions, passions, and
volitions. Tis unquestionable, therefore, that morality lies not in any of these
relations, nor the sense of it in their discovery.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>Shou'd it be asserted, that the sense of morality consists in the discovery
of some relation, distinct from these, and that our enumeration was not compleat,
when we comprehended all demonstrable relations under four general heads: To
this I know not what to reply, till some one be so good as to point out to me
this new relation. `Tis impossible to refute a system, which has never yet been
explain'd. In such a manner of fighting in the dark, a man loses his blows in
the air, and often places them where the enemy is not present.</p>
<p>I must, therefore, on this occasion, rest contented with requiring the two
following conditions of any one that wou'd undertake to clear up this system.
First, As moral good and evil belong only to the actions of the mind, and are
deriv'd from our situation with regard to external objects, the relations, from
which these moral distinctions arise, must lie only betwixt internal actions,
and external objects, and must not be applicable either to internal actions,
compared among themselves, or to external objects, when placed in opposition to
other external objects. For as morality is supposed to attend certain relations,
if these relations cou'd belong to internal actions consider'd singly, it wou'd
follow, that we might be guilty of crimes in ourselves, and independent of our
situation, with respect to the universe: And in like manner, if these moral
relations cou'd be apply'd to external objects, it wou'd follow, that even
inanimate beings wou'd be susceptible of moral beauty and deformity. Now it
seems difficult to imagine, that any relation can be discover'd betwixt our
passions, volitions and actions, compared to external objects, which relation
might not belong either to these passions and volitions, or to these external
objects, compar'd among themselves. But it will be still more difficult to
fulfil the second condition, requisite to justify this system. According to the
principles of those who maintain an abstract rational difference betwixt moral
good and evil, and a natural fitness and unfitness of things, `tis not only
suppos'd, that these relations, being eternal and immutable, are the same, when
consider'd by every rational creature, but their effects are also suppos'd to be
necessarily the same; and `tis concluded they have no less, or rather a greater,
influence in directing the will of the deity, than in governing the rational and
virtuous of our own species. These two particulars are evidently distinct. Tis
one thing to know virtue, and another to conform the will to it. In order,
therefore, to prove, that the measures of right and wrong are eternal laws,
obligatory on every rational mind, `tis not sufficient to shew the relations
upon which they are founded: We must also point out the connexion betwixt the
relation and the will; and must prove that this connexion is so necessary, that
in every well-disposed mind, it must take place and have its influence; tho' the
difference betwixt these minds be in other respects immense and infinite. Now
besides what I have already prov'd, that even in human nature no relation can
ever alone produce any action: besides this, I say, it has been shewn, in
treating of the understanding, that there is no connexion of cause and effect,
such as this is suppos'd to be, which is discoverable otherwise than by
experience, and of which we can pretend to have any security by the simple
consideration of the objects. All beings in the universe, consider'd in
themselves, appear entirely loose and independent of each other. Tis only by
experience we learn their influence and connexion; and this influence we ought
never to extend beyond experience.</p>
<p>Thus it will be impossible to fulfil the first condition required to the
system of eternal measures of right and wrong; because it is impossible to shew
those relations, upon which such a distinction may be founded: And `tis as
impossible to fulfil the second condition; because we cannot prove <em>a priori</em>,
that these relations, if they really existed and were perceiv'd, wou'd be
universally forcible and obligatory.</p>
<p>But to make these general reflections more dear and convincing, we may
illustrate them by some particular instances, wherein this character of moral
good or evil is the most universally acknowledged. Of all crimes that human
creatures are capable of committing, the most horrid and unnatural is
ingratitude, especially when it is committed against parents, and appears in the
more flagrant instances of wounds and death. This is acknowledg'd by all
mankind, philosophers as well as the people; the question only arises among
philosophers, whether the guilt or moral deformity of this action be discover'd
by demonstrative reasoning, or be felt by an internal sense, and by means of
some sentiment, which the reflecting on such an action naturally occasions. This
question will soon be decided against the former opinion, if we can shew the
same relations in other objects, without the notion of any guilt or iniquity
attending them. Reason or science is nothing but the comparing of ideas, and the
discovery of their relations; and if the same relations have different
characters, it must evidently follow, that those characters are not discover'd
merely by reason. To put the affair, therefore, to this trial, let us chuse any
inanimate object, such as an oak or elm; and let us suppose, that by the
dropping of its seed, it produces a sapling below it, which springing up by
degrees, at last overtops and destroys the parent tree: I ask, if in this
instance there be wanting any relation, which is discoverable in parricide or
ingratitude? Is not the one tree the cause of the other's existence; and the
latter the cause of the destruction of the former, in the same manner as when a
child murders his parent? Tis not sufficient to reply, that a choice or will is
wanting. For in the case of parricide, a will does not give rise to any <em>different</em>
relations, but is only the cause from which the action is deriv'd; and
consequently produces the same relations, that in the oak or elm arise from some
other principles. `Tis a will or choice, that determines a man to kill his
parent; and they are the laws of matter and motion, that determine a sapling to
destroy the oak, from which it sprung. Here then the same relations have
different causes; but still the relations are the same: And as their discovery
is not in both cases attended with a notion of immorality, it follows, that that
notion does not arise from such a discovery.</p>
<p>But to chuse an instance, still more resembling; I would fain ask any one,
why incest in the human species is criminal, and why the very same action, and
the same relations in animals have not the smallest moral turpitude and
deformity? If it be answer'd, that this action is innocent in animals, because
they have not reason sufficient to discover its turpitude; but that man, being
endow'd with that faculty which ought to restrain him to his duty, the same
action instantly becomes criminal to him; should this be said, I would reply,
that this is evidently arguing in a circle. For before reason can perceive this
turpitude, the turpitude must exist; and consequently is independent of the
decisions of our reason, and is their object more properly than their effect.
According to this system, then, every animal, that has sense, and appetite, and
will; that is, every animal must be susceptible of all the same virtues and
vices, for which we ascribe praise and blame to human creatures. All the
difference is, that our superior reason may serve to discover the vice or
virtue, and by that means may augment the blame or praise: But still this
discovery supposes a separate being in these moral distinctions, and a being,
which depends only on the will and appetite, and which, both in thought and
reality, may be distinguish'd from the reason. Animals are susceptible of the
same relations, with respect to each other, as the human species, and therefore
wou'd also be susceptible of the same morality, if the essence of morality
consisted in these relations. Their want of a sufficient degree of reason may
hinder them from perceiving the duties and obligations of morality, but can
never hinder these duties from existing; since they must antecedently exist, in
order to their being perceiv'd. Reason must find them, and can never produce
them. This argument deserves to be weigh'd, as being, in my opinion, entirely
decisive.</p>
<p>Nor does this reasoning only prove, that morality consists not in any
relations, that are the objects of science; but if examin'd, will prove with
equal certainty, that it consists not in any matter of fact, which can be
discover'd by the understanding. This is the second part of our argument; and if
it can be made evident, we may conclude, that morality is not an object of
reason. But can there be any difficulty in proving, that vice and virtue are not
matters of fact, whose existence we can infer by reason? Take any action allow'd
to be vicious: Wilful murder, for instance. Examine it in all lights, and see if
you can find that matter of fact, or real existence, which you call vice. In
which-ever way you take it, you find only certain passions, motives, volitions
and thoughts. There is no other matter of fact in the case. The vice entirely
escapes you, as long as you consider the object. You never can find it, till you
turn your reflection into your own breast, and find a sentiment of
disapprobation, which arises in you, towards this action. Here is a matter of
fact; but `tis the object of feeling, not of reason. It lies in yourself, not in
the object. So that when you pronounce any action or character to be vicious,
you mean nothing, but that from the constitution of your nature you have a
feeling or sentiment of blame from the contemplation of it. Vice and virtue,
therefore, may be compar'd to sounds, colours, heat and cold, which, according
to modern philosophy, are not qualities in objects, but perceptions in the mind:
And this discovery in morals, like that other in physics, is to be regarded as a
considerable advancement of the speculative sciences; tho', like that too, it
has little or no influence on practice. Nothing can be more real, or concern us
more, than our own sentiments of pleasure and uneasiness; and if these be
favourable to virtue, and unfavourable to vice, no more can be requisite to the
regulation of our conduct and behaviour.</p>
<p>I cannot forbear adding to these reasonings an observation, which may,
perhaps, be found of some importance. In every system of morality, which I have
hitherto met with, I have always remark'd, that the author proceeds for some
time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or
makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surpriz'd to
find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I
meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not.
This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as
this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, `tis
necessary that it shou'd be observ'd and explain'd; and at the same time that a
reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new
relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it.
But as authors do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend
it to the readers; and am persuaded, that this small attention wou'd subvert all
the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and
virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceiv'd by
reason.</p>
<p align="center">SECT. II</p>
<p align="center"><em>Moral distinctions deriv'd from a moral sense</em></p>
<p>Thus the course of the argument leads us to conclude, that since vice and
virtue are not discoverable merely by reason, or the comparison of ideas, it
must be by means of some impression or sentiment they occasion, that we are able
to mark the difference betwixt them. Our decisions concerning moral rectitude
and depravity are evidently perceptions; and as all perceptions are either
impressions or ideas, the exclusion of the one is a convincing argument for the
other. Morality, therefore, is more properly felt than judg'd of; tho' this
feeling or sentiment is commonly so soft and gentle, that we are apt to confound
it with an idea, according to our common custom of taking all things for the
same, which have any near resemblance to each other.</p>
<p>The next question is, Of what nature are these impressions, and after what
manner do they operate upon us? Here we cannot remain long in suspense, but must
pronounce the impression arising from virtue, to be agreeable, and that
proceding from vice to be uneasy. Every moments experience must convince us of
this. There is no spectacle so fair and beautiful as a noble and generous
action; nor any which gives us more abhorrence than one that is cruel and
treacherous. No enjoyment. equals the satisfaction we receive from the company
of those we love and esteem; as the greatest of all punishments is to be oblig'd
to pass our lives with those we hate or contemn. A very play or romance may
afford us instances of this pleasure, which virtue conveys to us; and pain,
which arises from vice.</p>
<p>Now since the distinguishing impressions, by which moral good or evil is
known, are nothing but particular pains or pleasures; it follows, that in all
enquiries concerning these moral distinctions, it will be sufficient to shew the
principles, which make us feel a satisfaction or uneasiness from the survey of
any character, in order to satisfy us why the character is laudable or blameable.
An action, or sentiment, or character is virtuous or vicious; why? because its
view causes a pleasure or uneasiness of a particular kind. In giving a reason,
therefore, for the pleasure or uneasiness, we sufficiently explain the vice or
virtue. To have the sense of virtue, is nothing but to feel a satisfaction of a
particular kind from the contemplation of a character. The very feeling
constitutes our praise or admiration. We go no farther; nor do we enquire into
the cause of the satisfaction. We do not infer a character to be virtuous,
because it pleases: But in feeling that it pleases after such a particular
manner, we in effect feel that it is virtuous. The case is the same as in our
judgments concerning all kinds of beauty, and tastes, and sensations. Our
approbation is imply'd in the immediate pleasure they convey to us.</p>
<p>I have objected to the system, which establishes eternal rational measures of
right and wrong, that `tis impossible to shew, in the actions of reasonable
creatures, any relations, which are not found in external objects; and
therefore, if morality always attended these relations, `twere possible for
inanimate matter to become virtuous or vicious. Now it may, in like manner, be
objected to the present system, that if virtue and vice be determin'd by
pleasure and pain, these qualities must, in every case, arise from the
sensations; and consequently any object, whether animate or inanimate, rational
or irrational, might become morally good or evil, provided it can excite a
satisfaction or uneasiness. But tho' this objection seems to be the very same,
it has by no means the same force, in the one case as in the other. For, first,
tis evident, that under the term pleasure, we comprehend sensations, which are
very different from each other, and which have only such a distant resemblance,
as is requisite to make them be express'd by the same abstract term. A good
composition of music and a bottle of good wine equally produce pleasure; and
what is more, their goodness is determin'd merely by the pleasure. But shall we
say upon that account, that the wine is harmonious, or the music of a good
flavour? In like manner an inanimate object, and the character or sentiments of
any person may, both of them, give satisfaction; but as the satisfaction is
different, this keeps our sentiments concerning them from being confounded, and
makes us ascribe virtue to the one, and not to the other. Nor is every sentiment
of pleasure or pain, which arises from characters and actions, of that peculiar
kind, which makes us praise or condemn. The good qualities of an enemy are
hurtful to us; but may still command our esteem and respect. `Tis only when a
character is considered in general, without reference to our particular
interest, that it causes such a feeling or sentiment, as denominates it morally
good or evil. `Tis true, those sentiments, from interest and morals, are apt to
be confounded, and naturally run into one another. It seldom happens, that we do
not think an enemy vicious, and can distinguish betwixt his opposition to our
interest and real villainy or baseness. But this hinders not, but that the
sentiments are, in themselves, distinct; and a man of temper and judgment may
preserve himself from these illusions. In like manner, tho' `tis certain a
musical voice is nothing but one that naturally gives a particular kind of
pleasure; yet `tis difficult for a man to be sensible, that the voice of an
enemy is agreeable, or to allow it to be musical. But a person of a fine ear,
who has the command of himself, can separate these feelings, and give praise to
what deserves it.</p>
<p><em>Secondly</em>, We may call to remembrance the preceding system of the
passions, in order to remark a still more considerable difference among our
pains and pleasures. Pride and humility, love and hatred are excited, when there
is any thing presented to us, that both bears a relation to the object of the
passion, and produces a separate sensation related to the sensation of the
passion. Now virtue and vice are attended with these circumstances. They must
necessarily be plac'd either in ourselves or others, and excite either pleasure
or uneasiness; and therefore must give rise to one of these four passions; which
clearly distinguishes them from the pleasure and pain arising from inanimate
objects, that often bear no relation to us: And this is, perhaps, the most
considerable effect that virtue and vice have upon the human mind.</p>
<p>It may now be ask'd in general, concerning this pain or pleasure, that
distinguishes moral good and evil, <em>From what principles is it derived , and
whence does it arise in the human mind?</em> To this I reply, first, that `tis
absurd to imagine, that in every particular instance, these sentiments are
produc'd by an original quality and primary constitution. For as the number of
our duties is, in a manner, infinite, `tis impossible that our original
instincts should extend to each of them, and from our very first infancy impress
on the human mind all that multitude of precepts, which are contain'd in the
compleatest system of ethics. Such a method of proceeding is not conformable to
the usual maxims, by which nature is conducted, where a few principles produce
all that variety we observe in the universe, and every thing is carry'd on in
the easiest and most simple manner. `Tis necessary, therefore, to abridge these
primary impulses, and find some more general principles, upon which all our
notions of morals are founded.</p>
<p>But in the second place, should it be ask'd, Whether we ought to search for
these principles in nature, or whether we must look for them in some other
origin? I wou'd reply, that our answer to this question depends upon the
definition of the word, Nature, than which there is none more ambiguous and
equivocal. If nature be oppos'd to miracles, not only the distinction betwixt
vice and virtue is natural, but also every event, which has ever happen'd in the
world, <em>excepting those miracles, on which our religion is founded.</em> In
saying, then, that the sentiments of vice and virtue are natural in this sense,
we make no very extraordinary discovery.</p>
<p>But nature may also be opposed to rare and unusual; and in this sense of the
word, which is the common one, there may often arise disputes concerning what is
natural or unnatural; and one may in general affirm, that we are not possess'd
of any very precise standard, by which these disputes can be decided. Frequent
and rare depend upon the number of examples we have observ'd; and as this number
may gradually encrease or diminish, `twill be impossible to fix any exact
boundaries betwixt them. We may only affirm on this head, that if ever there was
any thing, which cou'd be call'd natural in this sense, the sentiments of
morality certainly may; since there never was any nation of the world, nor any
single person in any nation, who was utterly depriv'd of them, and who never, in
any instance, shew'd the least approbation or dislike of manners. These
sentiments are so rooted in our constitution and temper, that without entirely
confounding the human mind by disease or madness, `tis impossible to extirpate
and destroy them.</p>
<p>But nature may also be opposed to artifice, as well as to what is rare and
unusual; and in this sense it may be disputed, whether the notions of virtue be
natural or not. We readily forget, that the designs, and projects, and views of
men are principles as necessary in their operation as heat and cold, moist and
dry: But taking them to be free and entirely our own, `tis usual for us to set
them in opposition to the other principles of nature. Shou'd it, therefore, be
demanded, whether the sense of virtue be natural or artificial, I am of opinion,
that `tis impossible for me at present to give any precise answer to this
question. Perhaps it will appear afterwards, that our sense of some virtues is
artificial, and that of others natural. The discussion of this question will be
more proper, when we enter upon an exact detail of each particular vice and
virtue.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a></p>
<p>Mean while it may not be amiss to observe from these definitions of natural
and unnatural, that nothing can be more unphilosophical than those systems,
which assert, that virtue is the same with what is natural, and vice with what
is unnatural. For in the first sense of the word, Nature, as opposed to
miracles, both vice and virtue are equally natural; and in the second sense, as
oppos'd to what is unusual, perhaps virtue will be found to be the most
unnatural. At least it must be own'd, that heroic virtue, being as unusual, is
as little natural as the most brutal barbarity. As to the third sense of the
word, `tis certain, that both vice and virtue are equally artificial, and out of
nature. For however it may be disputed, whether the notion of a merit or demerit
in certain actions be natural or artificial, `tis evident, that the actions
themselves are artificial, and are perform'd with a certain design and
intention; otherwise they cou'd never be rank'd under any of these
denominations. Tis impossible, therefore, that the character of natural and
unnatural can ever, in any sense, mark the boundaries of vice and virtue.</p>
<p>Thus we are still brought back to our first position, that virtue is
distinguished by the pleasure, and vice by the pain, that any action, sentiment
or character gives us by the mere view and contemplation. This decision is very
commodious; because it reduces us to this simple question, Why any action or
sentiment upon the general view or survey, gives a certain satisfaction or
uneasiness, in order to shew the origin of its moral rectitude or depravity,
without looking for any incomprehensible relations and qualities, which never
did exist in nature, nor even in our imagination, by any clear and distinct
conception. I flatter myself I have executed a great part of my present design
by a state of the question, which appears to me so free from ambiguity and
obscurity.</p>
