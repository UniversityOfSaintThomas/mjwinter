<center><b><i><font size=+1>Informed Consent and Human Dignity</font></i></b>
<p><b>Michael Winter</b>
<p><b>1994 : Working Draft</b></center>

<p><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what follows I will address issues and ideas
surrounding the question of whether or not the doctrine of informed consent
is most appropriately founded upon the notion of autonomy.&nbsp; As a simple
matter of fact these two principles are quite closely interrelated, but
it is not obviously the case that informed consent is rightly founded on
autonomy. I will suggest that the principle of autonomy provides an inadequate
theoretical basis for the doctrine of informed consent for reasons I will
explore.&nbsp; I think that the notion of human dignity is more basic or
fundamental than autonomy, and that the doctrine of informed consent would
be more appropriately grounded upon human dignity. Autonomy may indeed
fall out of the concept of human dignity since some plausible arguments
suggest that the latter is a broader and richer notion than the former.
Insofar as autonomy presupposes a definite conception of dignity, one to
which it can refer, it is a plausible basis for the doctrine of informed
consent, but situations which arise in experimental and therapeutic medicine
pertaining to proxy consent and experimentation on children tend to suggest
that autonomy is unable to pull the theoretical weight by itself.&nbsp;
Perhaps the broader notion of human dignity could handle this weight.&nbsp;
I find it odd that the idea at the heart of medical ethics, i.e. informed
consent, is founded on a principle pertaining to a property which a large
number of human beings lack, i.e. autonomy.&nbsp; Moreover, I assume that
if there are two candidate principles which could function as a theoretical
basis for informed consent and one is<i> ceteris paribus</i> simpler than
the other, then the simpler of the two is the more appropriate foundation.
I will consider whether dignity, given a fairly plausible understanding
of the notion, is a simpler principle than autonomy and whether <i>ceteris</i>
is <i>paribus</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intuitively, it is more reasonable to found
informed consent on a principle which covers all human beings. The fact
that we think that children and others who lack autonomy should be treated
with respect gives rise to the notion of proxy consent, a notion intended
to allow an autonomous person to act on behalf of an individual who lacks
autonomy. Plausible arguments can be made for the view that human dignity
is one property which all human beings possess in virtue of their nature
as rational beings. This notion is therefore a viable principle that might
capture the force we want informed consent to have without giving rise
to awkward states of affairs.&nbsp; If it turns out that human dignity
gives rise to a doctrine of informed consent that is too broad or too narrow
in scope, then debate should center around whether there are other possible
concepts that could adequately do the appropriate work. It is evident almost
immediately that progress here may require careful consideration of some
fundamental ethical concepts like human flourishing, respect and justice.
Unfortunately, in a paper of this length I will only have the opportunity
to point toward areas in which some of these ideas are likely to be relevant.
In general, it is my impression that informed consent would be most appropriately
formulated in light of the intentions of the Nuremberg Code. I will suggest
that dignity would be one way to capture these intentions.
<p><b>I. Informed Consent, Respect for Persons and Autonomy</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Informed consent is largely a product of experiments
in Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War. The Nuremberg
Code provided the standard against which the Nazi doctors were judged during
the War Crimes Trials in Germany. Ideas pertaining to informed consent
are at the heart of the document:
<dir>
<dir><i>(1) The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.
This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give
consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of
choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit,
duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion;
and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements
of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding
and enlightened decision.</i></dir>
</dir>
The fact that prisoners of war were forced subjects of research is quite
obviously unacceptable, and the Nuremberg Code sets a historical precedent
to the extent that it recognizes and articulates a principle which had
been blatantly abused by members of the Third Reich.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1964 the Declaration of Helsinki provided a revised
medical code similar to the earlier Nuremberg Code. The Declaration mentions
two important distinctions which were absent in the Nuremberg Code. The
first is the distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic research;
the second pertains to informed consent in the case of the legally incompetent.
Like the earlier Code, the Declaration takes seriously the notion of informed
consent, but it is noteworthy that there is much less emphasis on the idea.
It occurs explicitly in the following two passages:
<dir>
<dir>(<i>6) The right of the research subject to safeguard his or her integrity
must always be respected. Every precaution should be taken to respect the
privacy of the subject and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's
physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject.</i>
<p><i>(9) In any research on human beings, each potential subject must
be adequately informed of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential
hazards of the study and the discomfort it may entail. He or she should
be informed that he or she is at liberty to abstain from participation
in the study and that he or she is free to withdraw his or her consent
to participation at any time. The doctor should then obtain the subject's
freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing.</i></dir>
</dir>
Though the Declaration provides a more specific statement of informed consent,
the document on the whole clearly places less emphasis on the doctrine.
The fact that it occurs toward the end of the list of basic principles
is one strong indication that informed consent is not nearly as central
to this document as it was in the Nuremberg Code.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, two important elements of informed
consent are present in both documents. The first is that subjects be provided
with sufficient information regarding the nature of the research being
performed. The second is that the patient freely consents to the proposed
procedure. An idea common to both of these elements is the principle that
individuals are worthy of being treated as ends in themselves and not as
means to ends. One fundamental problem with Nazi experimentation was that
humans subjects were used as instruments or objects. Given that human beings
should be treated as ends in themselves, they should be allowed to make
decisions with respect to options they may wish to pursue.&nbsp; Autonomy
is closely connected with dignity; both ideas are related to informed consent
in important ways.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phrase "respect for persons" appears to
be another way of expressing the concept of human dignity. The Department
of Health, Education and Welfare's 1979 Belmont Report outlines the relationship
between informed consent and respect for persons.
<dir>
<dir>1. <i>Informed Consent.</i>- Respect for persons requires that subjects,
to the degree that they are capable, be given the opportunity to choose
what shall or shall not happen to them. This opportunity is provided when
adequate standards for informed consent are satisfied.</dir>
</dir>
Respect for persons is articulated earlier in the report as follows:
<dir>
<dir>1. <i>Respect for Persons</i>.- Respect for persons incorporates at
least two ethical convictions: first, that individuals should be treated
as autonomous agents, and second, that persons with diminished autonomy
are entitled to protection. The principle of respect for persons thus divides
into two separate moral requirements: the requirement to acknowledge autonomy
and the requirement to protect those with diminished autonomy.
<p>An autonomous person is an individual capable of deliberation about
personal goals and of acting under the direction of such deliberation.</dir>
</dir>
To the extent that autonomy and human dignity are related, respect for
persons is related to dignity, since respect for persons is simply one
particular way of explaining autonomy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to better understand whether the idea
of respect for persons is the same is dignity, it will be helpful to present
an Aristotelian distinction in light of which the difference between dignity
and autonomy is more readily apparent. In the <u>De Anima</u> Aristotle
draws a distinction between two types of actuality:
<dir>
<dir><i>Now the word 'actuality' has two senses corresponding respectively
to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.</i></dir>
</dir>
Even though Aristotle is interested in defining the soul, and he makes
use of the distinction between two types of actuality to do so, one can
apply the distinction generally since it is meant to capture the difference
between a capacity and the exercise of a capacity. Is it at all helpful
to understand the distinction between dignity and autonomy as mirroring
the that Aristotle draws? What would it amount to? Since dignity seems
to be a feature that all human beings possess, it is reasonable to think
of it as the possession of a capacity, i.e. the capacity to think and choose
for oneself. If this is so, then autonomy might be best understood as corresponding
to the actual ability human beings have to think and choose.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To justify this approach, suppose we ask ourselves
"Do all human beings have dignity?". I think that the answer to this question
is "Yes, they do."&nbsp; But consider the question "Do all human beings
have autonomy?"&nbsp; We are not inclined to answer this second question
in the way we answered the first. Why not? Because autonomy corresponds
to the ability we have to think and choose for ourselves, an ability that
properly developed members of the human species possess. Since we are inclined
to say that all human beings have dignity, dignity cannot be the same thing
as autonomy.&nbsp; Indeed, it looks like dignity is more fundamental than
autonomy. Aristotle's distinction between two types of actuality is a way
of supporting the contention that dignity is more fundamental than autonomy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If dignity is essentially the right which humans
have to be treated as ends in themselves and not as means in virtue of
an important <u>capacity</u> humans have <i>qua</i> members of the species,
then respect for persons as explained in the Belmont Report is not the
same as dignity-- the latter is a broader and more general notion since
"respect for persons" involves both a <u>capacity</u> and an <u>ability</u>.
So even though it looks at first glance as though the doctrine of informed
consent is primarily founded on human dignity, a look at how the phrase
"respect for persons" is articulated shows that it is really autonomy,
i.e. an operation or use of a capacity, which underlies and grounds informed
consent at the theoretical level.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Aristotelian distinction presented above
captures the intuitive distinction between dignity and autonomy, then a
being has dignity if and only if it possesses the power to think and choose
for itself in virtue of its membership in a species that is typified by
such a capacity. A being is autonomous, however, just in case it is able
to put the aforementioned capacity to use, i.e. actually thinking and choosing
for itself. It is important to note that it cannot be autonomy, the operation
of this capacity, that sets humans apart from other species even though
only humans have this ability. Why? Because if actual thinking and choosing
were the feature of human beings setting them apart from other animals,
then infants, young children and the mentally incompetent are would not
be members of the species since they lack this specific ability. So it
must be the <u>capacity</u> to perform such operations which sets humans
apart from the rest of the animal kingdom.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, autonomy is the theoretical principle
upon which the doctrine of informed consent is based.&nbsp; Autonomy is
meaningfully related to the fundamental idea that humans should be respected
and treated fairly. Furthermore, autonomy involves the idea that all who
possess it have at least the <u>capacity</u> to think and choose for themselves.
The notion of autonomy is intimately connected with the latter. A.M. Capron
addresses this point nicely:
<dir>
<dir><i>The requirement of informed consent has two parts, both of which
must be met before medical intervention is permissible: first, that sufficient
information is disclosed to the patient so that he can arrive at an intelligent
opinion, and second that the patient agrees to the intervention being performed.
The latter facet in particular reflects the concern, traditional in western
societies, that the autonomy of the person be respected.</i></dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <u>The Theory and Practice of Autonomy</u>,
Gerald Dworkin presents an elaborate discussion of the notion of autonomy
and how, in particular, it relates to the doctrine of informed consent.
Dworkin believes that the doctrine of informed consent is rightly founded
upon the notion of autonomy. He defines 'autonomy' as follows:
<dir>
<dir><i>I am defining autonomy as the capacity to reflect upon one's motivational
structure and to make changes in that structure. Thus, autonomy is not
simply a reflective capacity but also includes some ability to alter one's
preferences and to make them effective in action. Indeed to make them effective
partly because one has reflected upon them and adopted them as one's own.
(Italics mine)</i></dir>
</dir>
As Dworkin defines it, the notion of autonomy makes reference to both of
the human operations previously acknowledged by Capron in the doctrine
of informed consent, i.e. thinking and making informed choices. In fact,
Dworkin rightly treats these two operations as though they are intimately
connected. His account makes an interesting suggestion about a specific
human operation, i.e. altering one's preferences, which must also be present--
a <u>capacity</u> for an operation is not sufficient for an operation itself,
whatever it might be. Dworkin's discussion of the theoretical justification
for autonomy as a value suggests that it is because individuals are autonomous
that they deserve to be treated with dignity:
<dir>
<dir><i>It is because other persons are creators of their own lives, are
shapers of their own values, are the originators of projects and plans,
that their interests must be taken into account, their rights respected,
their projects valued....Moral respect is owed to all because all have
(assuming we are dealing with normal persons, not defective or incompetent
in serious ways) the capacity for autonomous development. (Italics mine)</i></dir>
</dir>
Assuming that the concept of dignity can be generally understood as the
idea that individuals deserve to be treated as ends and never as means
because they have a <u>capacity</u> to be autonomous, and given the fact
that autonomy and dignity are conceptually distinct because autonomy involves
the exercise of a power, one might entertain ideas about whether a person
is autonomous because he has dignity or has dignity because he is autonomous?
This question is reminiscent of the one in Plato's <u>Euthyphro</u> when
Socrates, after hearing Euthyphro define 'piety' as what is loved by all
the gods, asks Euthyphro whether the gods love an action because it is
pious or is it pious because the gods love it? The exchange that follows
is quite difficult to interpret and understand.&nbsp; Without going into
the details of the argument from the <u>Euthyphro</u>, it seems that the
general question in the dialogue could be applied with some profit to the
present context. Gerald Dworkin's theory of autonomy looks as though it
would commit him to the alternative that it is because persons have autonomy
that they must be treated with dignity. Dworkin does not explicitly consider
the approach I have presented, but his account gains its force from the
emphasis he places on the alternative he advocates. Is this the best answer
to the question? I will attempt to show that it is not. Moreover, I will
offer some justification for thinking the alternative Dworkin implicitly
rejects paves the way for a more complete theoretical underpinning for
informed consent.
<p><b>II. Human Dignity and Autonomy</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before directly treating the question just
posed, I will attempt to explain why I think this question is important
to ponder. Why should the relationship between informed consent and autonomy
be thought about more carefully? As I mentioned at the outset, informed
consent plays a central role in current medical practice. There is, however,
a wide range of fairly ordinary cases that informed consent cannot deal
with directly. I suggest that this is because informed consent is based
on autonomy which is too narrow in scope.&nbsp; Inparticular, it is too
specific in light of the fact that it is based on the exercise of particular
operations. One category of cases which presents a problem for informed
consent are cases of patient incompetence. Children and the mentally incompetent
do not fall within the direct scope of informed consent because they do
not have the ability to make genuinely free choices, so they are not fully
autonomous. The mentally incompetent may possess some physical defect that
acconts for this fact while children under a certain age are not mature
enough to make genuinely free decisions, but both groups of individuals
have the relevant capacities given that they are members of the species.
To the extent that informed consent is founded upon the notion of autonomy,
it is reasonable to say that incompetent patients (both the mentally incompetent
and children) fall outside of its scope since they are not autonomous agents.
But since it is clearly unreasonable to allow the incompetent to be experimented
upon, one must come up with some way of accounting for the respect due
to such individuals. This is presently done by requiring that a fully autonomous
agent who is interested in the well-being of the patient act on the patient's
behalf so as to provide the requisite informed consent. One can see in
such cases how the idea of respect for persons works and why it is necessary
if informed consent is founded primarily on autonomy. Situations of the
sort require the consent of a proxy who is fully autonomous.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what if the proxy is mistaken about
the best interests of the patient? Even if one grants that the proxy, by
definition, is an individual who is primarily concerned with the best interests
of the non-autonomous patient, the possibility remains that the proxy is
simply mistaken about the best interests of the person for whom he or she
is asked to make a decision. Certainly individuals can be, and often are,
mistaken about what is in their own best interest; it shouldn't be surprising
to discover that they could be mistaken about the interests of another.
The very fact that individuals can be mistaken about the best interests
of another even though their concerns may be genuine is one of the central
motivations behind the doctrine of informed consent.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emergency cases also pose problems for informed
consent. Emergency situations are ones in which patients are usually unable
to give or receive information, so any consent a patient might give in
such situations would not qualify as being informed. But it certainly seems
right in emergency situations, at least ones which involve a threat to
a patient's life, to go ahead with treatment since the treatment is therapeutic.
Why? Here one might respond in one of two ways. One could say that a doctor
who performs a therapeutic procedure on a non-consenting patient whose
life is at stake is acting on behalf of the patient's future autonomy.
Another way to respond is that the doctor is not only justified in performing
emergency treatment but obliged to by virtue of the fact that doing so
accords with the dignity of the patient while acting otherwise would be
a clear violation of the patient's right to be treated as an end in him/herself.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One could also consider emergency situations
in which it is limb and not life that is at stake. It looks as if the replies
would be largely similar in nature. If autonomy is the sole basis for informed
consent, then emergency situations present exceptions to informed consent
insofar as the (present) autonomy of the patient is overridden. If the
theoretical basis for informed consent is based on human dignity, then
the situation is much simpler-- the doctor would be acting consistently
with human dignity (the respect due to humans in virtue of the fact that
they have a <u>capacity</u> to think and choose) in undergoing therapeutic
treatment, insofar as a competent doctor is an expert. Informed consent
based on human dignity could handle emergency cases quite easily. One might
notice that whichever theoretical foundation one chooses, informed consent
would dictate that the same actions be done in these particular cases;
it is the conceptual framework which lies behind the decision which would
differentiate these alternatives. Dignity might be a preferable basis for
informed consent in emergency cases since it is more simple-- one need
not make any distinction between present and future autonomy which appears
to be <i>ad hoc</i>. These distinctions in emergency cases are probably
not enough to show that informed consent would be more appropriately founded
upon dignity, but these cases in conjunction with other types of cases
do, in my view, present a fairly strong case..
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We might worry that treating emergency cases
in this way may allow one to treat incompetent patients in any way one
chooses in any circumstances. But if one keeps in mind the Aristotelian
distinction drawn earlier, then one will notice that incompetent persons
<i>qua</i> persons have a <u>capacity</u> to think and choose for themselves.
Any being with this capacity deserves to be treated as a being who could
exercise this capacity would. It is here where the notion of human flourishing
is relevant. Even if one is reluctant to acknowledge that there is some
set of actions which are properly ordered toward human flourishing, it
is undeniable that there are certain activities that are conducive to biological
flourishing, i.e, health, which is necessary for human flourishing. To
take an extreme example, hacking off healthy limbs for no apparent reason
conflicts with the biological end of human being or any other animal--
it is not healthy treatment. Treatment of this sort will be clearly ruled
out by informed consent based on dignity in the sense I have explained.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respecting dignity in emergency cases consists
in performing the treatment&nbsp; most conducive to a patient's overall
health depending on the circumstances, which must be assessed by a competent
doctor whose expertise is often necessary. So we could state the idea this
way-- since even incompetent persons have a <u>capacity</u> to be rational
in virtue of the fact that they are members of the human species, and health
is one of the ends which must be pursued by human beings if the species
is to persist, we must treat incompetent persons in a way which is (minimally)
conducive to his/her health.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dworkin's discussion of therapeutic privilege
and autonomy is worth looking at somewhat closely. Therapeutic privilege
gives rise to another category of cases that lead us to question whether
informed consent is appropriately founded upon autonomy. He says the following:
<dir>
<dir><i>Therapeutic privilege may be conceived as the opposite side of
the coin of waiver. In waiver the patient decides that certain information
will be harmful or cause distress and that he would be better off not having
it. In therapeutic privilege the doctor decides that securing informed
consent would be harmful to the patient and that he is better off not having
it. It is a privilege because it allows exemption from a duty; it is therapeutic
because it is intended for the benefit of the patient. This exception raises
the clearest conflict between the value of autonomy and what is considered
the best interests of the patient.</i></dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One feature of this account which is worthy of
note is the point that autonomy can conflict with the best interests of
an individual, which supports the idea advocated earlier, namely that individuals
might just be mistaken about what is truly in their best interest and how
to achieve it. Dworkin appears to be willing to endorse the idea that a
doctor, insofar as he is an expert, may in fact be the best judge in many
cases regarding the medical interests of a patient.&nbsp;&nbsp; Acknowledgement
of this point allows us to see the tension between autonomy and paternalism.
Paternalism is the idea that one can override an individual's autonomous
decisions in an attempt to secure the individual's best interests. Paternalism
surely assumes that individuals do in fact have best interests and that
their autonomous choices might work against them or at least not toward
them.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reiterate, even if one is unwilling to acknowledge
that there is some set of objective actions which constitute human flourishing
and that it is in an individual's best interests to perform these, it is
undeniable that human beings are biological animals and therefore have
certain natural dispositions against which it would be harmful to act.
Could it turn out that an individual is mistaken about his own biological
best interest? It seems that a person could be. For years many individuals
thought it was healthy to get a fair amount of exposure to the sun during
the summer months. Fairly recent medical evidence, however, indicates that
long-term exposure to the sun is likely to lead to some forms of skin cancer.
It is therefore better for the average person to expose hher skin less
than she may have naively expected.&nbsp; Cases of this sort require the
knowledge of experts to decide what is the fact of the matter. One could
come up with similar situations regarding a person's diet. The point is
that in at least some cases individuals could be genuinely mistaken about
their best medical interests. Competent doctors or other medical experts
are the best authorities regarding health.
<p>How do these points pertain to the discussion about informed consent,
dignity and autonomy? If autonomy is the basis for informed consent, then
therapeutic privilege presents another exception since it involves paternalism.
If, however, dignity were the basis of informed consent, then cases of
paternalism would not conflict with informed consent and so therapeutic
privilege would not pose a serious problem. Since, according to human dignity,
individuals ought to be treated as ends in themselves in virtue of a <u>capacity</u>
they have, there is nothing which would obviously rule out paternalistic
cases. Dignity leaves open the idea that individuals may in fact treat
themselves instrumentally thereby rendering such activity incompatible
with what is genuinely in their best interests. In such cases, it may be
necessary that an individual's decision be overridden by that of an expert.
Informed consent (based on human dignity) and paternalism are perfectly
compatible; paternalism may indeed present an exception to informed consent
founded on autonomy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is a bit odd that the notion underpinning
informed consent is not powerful enough to adequately deal with the categories
of cases that have been presented. With regard to the first category, it
is awkward to have some agents acting on the behalf a large population
of incompetent individuals. This point also applies to emergency situations.
Pertaining to the last category of cases, paternalism seems intuitively
justifiable some of the time, and it is such situations which present exceptions
to informed consent. It seems to me that if there is a broader notion that
would avoid some of the awkward consequences while retaining the original
intentions that motivated the doctrine of informed consent, then it is
this notion that should be adopted, especially if the notion replacing
autonomy accounts for everything it does much more simply. I have suggested
that the notion of human dignity is a more appropriate theoretical foundation
for the doctrine of informed consent.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To go back to the question posed at the close
of the previous section, it is reasonable to ask whether people have dignity
because they are autonomous or autonomous because they have dignity? I
think that the second alternative deserves to be taken seriously. As I
mentioned, some agents are autonomous and others are not. Given Dworkin's
definition, autonomy is a property which mature, properly-functioning adults
possess. Children, for example, are agents who lack autonomy, but surely
they still deserve to be treated with respect. Why should the interests
of children be taken into account? Because they are human beings, and all
human beings deserve to be treated as ends in themselves insofar as they
are members of the species typified by certain <u>capacities</u>. But since
children lack autonomy, it surely cannot be this property that mandates
treating them with respect. So if my interpretation of Dworkin's account
is correct, then it looks as if it could be read as implying that children
and the mentally incompetent should not be treated with respect since they
lack the property in virtue of which individuals deserve respect. But since
this implication is unacceptable, and Dworkin surely thinks that it is,
something more needs to be said to cover children and the mentally incompetent--
this is precisely where proxy consent plays its role. If one says that
agents have dignity because they are autonomous, and dignity is just the
right to be respected in virtue of a <u>capacity</u>, then children and
the mentally incompetent should not be respected since they lack autonomy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, one approaches this question the
other way, i.e., that people are autonomous (at least) because they have
dignity, then one can possibly avoid this awkward consequence. If autonomy
is a "reflective capacity" and an "ability to alter one's preferences"(both
of which appear to be operations), then it makes sense to think that an
agent who has this <u>capacity</u> and this <u>ability</u> has a nature
of a certain sort which gives rise to these operations. Human dignity is
one way of articulating an important component of what it is to be a human
being. This line of thought could be more adequately treated in light of
a discussion about the notion of human flourishing-- the present context
does not lend itself to a discussion of this sort. One can pursue the weaker
line advocated earlier which bases the discussion on the biological best
interests of human beings <i>qua</i> biological animals.
<p><b>III. Human Dignity as a Theoretical Basis for Informed Consent</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What good does it do to draw a distinction
between human dignity and autonomy and then argue that the former is more
conceptually fundamental than the latter? If one grants the assumption
that the current state of affairs (in which autonomy is a basis for informed
consent) gives rise to distinctions which are at best awkward, then it
is appropriate to seek a notion- an arguably richer one- which does the
work that autonomy does more simply. Human dignity might be the appropriate
notion.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must keep in mind the distinction
between therapeutic and non-therapeutic cases. For purposes of comparison
let us call the current principle of informed consent which is based on
autonomy IC. The modification I am suggesting would base informed consent
on human dignity; let us call this notion IC*. I hope that it is fairly
clear at this point at least that these two principles are distinct. It
will be useful to briefly look at the practical difference between IC and
IC* in both therapeutic and non-therapeutic cases.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the discussion above hopefully indicates,
in therapeutic cases there is little if any difference between IC and IC*
with respect to actual outcomes of particular cases. In therapeutic cases
involving children and the mentally incompetent both IC and IC* require
that caregivers provide the necessary treatment so as to restore the patient
back to good health. The difference lies in the fact that IC forces one
to hold that since the patients are not autonomous individuals, the consent
of some fully autonomous proxy is required. IC* requires no such distinction;
what has to be determined is what, as a matter of fact, is in the best
interests of the patient (it is assumed that the goal here is health).
What is ruled out is that the patient be treated as a means to an end.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In therapeutic emergency cases the outcomes
are again quite similar. IC cannot by itself account for these cases--
in typical emergency situations patients are unable to give consent. Furthermore,
many emergency cases require immediate action which does not make room
for proxy consent. Our good sense tells us that treatment ought to be provided
in these cases. It is here that IC begins to show its inadequacy. IC*,
on the other hand, requires that therapy be performed on the grounds that
it is in the best medical interest of the patient (again, given that the
purpose of the treatment is health). Again, one must avoid treating individuals
as instruments. So in cases of this sort, whether one appeals to IC or
IC* the actual outcomes are quite similar. The real difference lies in
the fact that IC* can provide a simple justification for the requisite
course of treatment while IC cannot.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-therapeutic cases may yield different
outcomes. According to IC an experiment is allowable if an autonomous individual
consents to it. Experimentation on children requires the consent of an
autonomous individual and at least the assent of the patient. It is assumed
that individuals will be generally capable of calculating the genuine risks
and benefits of any particular procedure and that they would not choose
those which present more harm than benefit. IC* would rule out any experiment
which treated an individual as a means. If, as a matter of fact, the potential
harms outweigh the potential benefits, then IC* would mandate that the
procedure not be performed.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can now see the paternalistic side of IC*.
One gets the impression that IC is an attempt to move away from paternalism
toward the concerns of the patient-- this comes at the expense of simplicity.
At the end of the day, however, even staunch advocates of IC and autonomy
(like Dworkin) are willing to make room for paternalism in some cases.
So there is nothing wrong with paternalism in principle; the problem lies
in its practical applications. How can we safeguard the rights of individuals
if decisions about procedures to be performed on them are up to others?
How can we be sure that paternalism will not end up allowing that more
individuals be treated as means as a practical matter?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since one side of IC* is essentially
paternalistic it needs some sort of qualification to fully account for
the fact that individuals are autonomous agents. I mentioned at the outset
that autonomy and dignity are closely related concepts. I also indicated
that I would try to provide good reasons for thinking that autonomy should
play an important role in the doctrine of informed consent. Providing an
adequate framework for informed consent requires one to offer an account
which captures the force of our pretheoretic ideas-- one which does not
assign autonomy some important role will be unacceptable. It is our intuitions
which allow us to see how autonomy is necessary for informed consent. These
are the same intuitions which lie behind the Nuremberg Code. I have presented
a few problems which collectively suggest that autonomy is not a sufficient
theoretical basis for informed consent, but that human dignity might be.
So it is reasonable to expect that informed consent should be founded upon
both dignity and autonomy since these two notions are so intimately connected.
If human dignity is in fact the more fundamental of the two notions and
it is utilized as a basis for informed consent, then one has a way to account
for and explain in a fairly straightforward manner the categories of cases
I have presented.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major difference between this construal
of informed consent, the one I have called IC*, and the usual one is that
the former is explicitly open to the possibility of paternalism. Paternalism
will have to be accounted for and explained somehow-- IC provides no natural
way to do so. Although the Nuremberg Code does not mention paternalism
and seems to rule it out altogether, medical practice since the Second
World War presents exceptions to informed consent as it was restrictively
introduced. Since some sort of modification is in order if the questions
I raise are compelling, the real question is how to account for the intentions
behind the Code while making room for what medical practice in the last
few decades has taught us. It is my view that the current state of affairs
surrounding informed consent is somewhat awkward and that this should force
us to carefully reconsider the foundations of the doctrine of informed
consent. This preliminary look at the foundations hopefully provides some
reason for thinking that human dignity is a more appropriate foundation
for informed consent than is autonomy.
