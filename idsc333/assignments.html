<p><b>Assignment #12</b>
<br>Please respond to the following by the end of the day next Monday.
We will watch a film that touches this issue next Tuesday. Your required
postings for this week can fall anywhere within the realm of technology
and ethics. Feel free to create your own topic.
<p>I am not giving a new reading assignment this week so as to give you
ample opportunity to read around to find a good paper topic. Please use
this time wisely.
<p>Research on human subjects requires informed consent, but we might wonder
whether informed consent should be a criterion for such research. Most
would agree that we ought not to experiment on human subjects without informed
consent, but does the presence of informed consent warrant such experimentation?
In other words, is it possible to think of a scenario in which someone
gives informed consent for a procedure which would be wrong to perform?
What would be the basis for
<br>saying that it would be wrong to perform such a procedure?
<p><b>Assignment #13</b>
<br>Here is a link to a draft of a paper on human dignity and informed
consent that I wrote in graduate school. Please read it and then make comments
here about any of the ideas in it. The footnotes are missing, but I can
supply the references if you want them.
