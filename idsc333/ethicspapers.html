<center><b><i><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>Papers for Phil 214</font></font></i></b></center>

<p>There are two short papers required for this course. Papers should be
about 3 (double spaced) pages in length. Written assignments are intended
to provide an opportunity for you to present and assess an argument.&nbsp;
Organization will be weighed heavily, and grammar will count. Each paper
will be worth 15% of
<br>your final grade.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><b><font color="#000099"><font size=+1>Structure for Papers</font></font></b>
<p>I. Introduction
<br>II. Presentation of Argument
<br>III. Assessment of Argument
<br>IV. Conclusion
<p><b>I. Introduction-</b> In this portion of the paper present the question
or thesis you intend to address. You might explain the context in which
the question/thesis occurs. For example, if you are treating Plato's recollection
argument, you might mention how this argument fits into Plato's overall
strategy in the Phaedo.
<p><b>II. Presentation of Argument-</b> Now present the main argument.
For the sake of clarity and organization, state the argument in one of
the forms covered on the logic handout (as has been done in class and in
homework). Use the text to support the premises of the argument. If the
argument is not explicitly stated in any of the forms we have discussed,
see if you are able to make it fit one of the patterns while doing justice
to the intended line of thought (remember the Principle of Charity here).
Explain the stages in the argument and discuss what it purports to show.
<p><b>III. Assessment of Argument-</b> At this stage you will be in a position
to discuss (a) the legitimacy of the inference (valid or invalid) and (b)
the truth or falsity of the premises. Analyze each premise of the argument
by stating the evidence or principles upon which they are based. Discuss
strengths and weaknesses in the argument. Note: This portion of the paper
is where creativity plays its role. Use your imagination to come up with
an example of your own to illustrate the reasoning you employ.
<p><b>IV. Conclusion</b>- A conclusion gives you the opportunity to wrap
things up. Summarize the reasoning and analysis you have employed. Also,
state your own view of the matter. Why are you reluctant or willing to
accept the conclusion? You might state some possible implications of the
argument you assess.</blockquote>

<p><b><font color="#000099"><font size=+1>Paper Assignment #1</font></font></b>
<p>In the final issue of the television show M.A.S.H., civilians and soldiers
are hiding in a bus in cover from the North Korean Enemy.&nbsp; As the
enemy troops near the place where the bus is hidden, a woman's baby begins
to cry.&nbsp; The woman tries to calm the baby so that the enemy will not
detect the bus, but the baby continues to cry.&nbsp; In desperation, the
woman suffocates the baby with her own hand.&nbsp; Hawkeye is so overwhelmed
by the incident that he later loses emotional control.&nbsp; After much
psychiatric work, Hawkeye is able to come to terms with the episode.
<p>Suppose that everyone in the bus would have been killed had the enemy
detected the bus.&nbsp; Suppose that woman who suffocates the baby has
good reason for believing this fact.&nbsp; A good utilitarian would argue
that she has done the right thing, and that Hawkeye's response to the incident
is a sign of moral weakness or ignorance.
<p>Construct a formally valid argument that a utilitarian would offer to
justify the woman's action.&nbsp; Take the conclusion of the argument to
be: Sacrificing my baby's life is morally required.
<p>What would Kant and Aquinas have to say about this action?&nbsp; Incorporate
the views of these theorists into your analysis.&nbsp; Once you set up
a valid utilitarian argument in section 2, explain the premises of the
argument using the theoretical considerations from Mill that support it.
<p>In section 3 critically evaluate the argument using theoretical considerations
from Kant and Aquinas that count against the truth of the premises of the
argument.
<p>Provide an example of your own that justifies one of the criticisms
in section 3.

<p><font color="#000000"><b>&nbsp; </b>In class we will look at arguments
on both sides of the abortion debate.&nbsp; In the last paper you are to
present the strongest argument you can find from one side of the issue.&nbsp;
Follow the paper guidelines above. You should choose your opponent's best
argument for the one you will present in the beginning of the paper.&nbsp;
Make use of any material from this course that supports the premises of
the argument you present.&nbsp; The argument you present for your opponent's
view should be forceful and somewhat persuasive.&nbsp; You will have to
be dispassionate to carry out this task successfully.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp; Now assess the argument with objections
from the other side of the issue in mind (assess the truth of each premise).&nbsp;
Make as much use of material discussed in class as possible. For the purposes
of this assignment, I am not interested in which view you ultimately accept,
but in how well you can present and challenge your opponent's view while
defending your own.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp; Remember to use examples of your own where
relevant.&nbsp; Also, be sure to keep your paper focused on the main argument.</font>
