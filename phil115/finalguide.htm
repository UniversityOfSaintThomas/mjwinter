<b><font size=+1>Study Guide for the Final</font></b>
<p>The exam will cover material from, Searle, Chalmers, and Aristotle/Aquinas.
I
<br>expect that you will be familiar with the readings we have addressed
from each author. You
<br>may use the questions assigned for each philosopher along with the
responses you have
<br>provided to help focus your preparation for the exam.
<p>Here are some general topics from which I might construct an essay question:
<p>-Searle's solution to the mind/body problem (ch.1)
<br>-Searle on the refutation of AI. (ch.2)
<br>-Searle on free will/determinism/compatibilism (ch.6)
<br>-Chalmers on materialism/Chalmers' dualism
<p>-Aquinas' modus tollens argument against materialism (Q.75, a.1)
<br>-An argument against hylomorphism along with Aquinas' response (Q.76,
a.1, obj.1)
<br>-Arguments about gender and human nature (Assignment #10).
<p>I expect that you will familiar with all course material since mid-semester.
<br>I will not ask any questions like those that appear on logic quizzes.
