But as this enterprise appeared to be a verygreat one, I waited until I had attained an age so mature that I couldnot hope that at any later date I should be better fitted to execute mydesign. This reason caused me to delay so long that I should feel thatI was doing wrong were I to occupy in deliberation the time that yet remainsto me for action. To-day, then, since very opportunely for the plan I havein view I have delivered my mind from every care [and am happily agitatedby no passions] and since I have procured for myself an assured leisurein a peaceable retirement, I shall at last seriously and freely addressmyself to the general upheaval of all my former opinions. </P><P>Now for this object it is not necessary that I should show that allof these are false -- I shall perhaps never arrive at this end. But inasmuchas reason already persuades me that I ought no less carefully to withholdmy assent from matters which are not entirely certain and indubitable thanfrom those which appear to me manifestly to be false, if I am able to findin each one some reason to doubt, this will suffice to justify my rejectingthe whole. And for that end it will not be requisite that I should examineeach in particular, which would be an endless undertaking; for owing tothe fact that the destruction of the foundations of necessity brings withit the downfall of the rest of the edifice, I shall only in the first placeattack those principles upon which all my former opinions rested. </P><P>All that up to the present time I have accepted as most true and certainI have learned either from the senses or through the senses; but it issometimes proved to me that these senses are deceptive, and it is wisernot to trust entirely to anything by which we have once been deceived.</P><P>But it may be that although the senses sometimes deceive us concerningthings which are hardly perceptible, or very far away, there are yet manyothers to be met with as to which we cannot reasonably have any doubt,although we recognise them by their means. For example, there is the factthat I am here, seated by the fire, attired in a dressing gown, havingthis paper in my hands and other similar matters. And how could I denythat these hands and this body are mine, were it not perhaps that I comparemyself to certain persons, devoid of sense, whose cerebella are so troubledand clouded by the violent vapours of black bile, that they constantlyassure us that they think they are kings when they are really quite poor,or that they are clothed in purple when they are really without covering,or who imagine that they have an earthenware head or are nothing but pumpkinsor are made of glass. But they are mad, and I should not be any the lessinsane were I to follow examples so extravagant. </P><P>At the same time I must remember that I am a man, and that consequentlyI am in the habit of sleeping, and in my dreams representing to myselfthe same things or sometimes even less probable things, than do those whoare insane in their waking moments. How often has it happened to me thatin the night I dreamt that I found myself in this particular place, thatI was dressed and seated near the fire, whilst in reality I was lying undressedin bed! At this moment it does indeed seem to me that it is with eyes awakethat I am looking at this paper; that this head which I move is not asleep,that it is deliberately and of set purpose that I extend my hand and perceiveit; what happens in sleep does not appear so clear nor so distinct as doesall this. But in thinking over this I remind myself that on many occasionsI have in sleep been deceived by similar illusions, and in dwelling carefullyon this reflection I see so manifestly that there are no certain indicationsby which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep that I am lostin astonishment. And my astonishment is such that it is almost capableof persuading me that I now dream. </P><P>Now let us assume that we are asleep and that all these particulars,e.g. that we open our eyes, shake our head, extend our hands, and so on,are but false delusions; and let us reflect that possibly neither our handsnor our whole body are such as they appear to us to be. At the same timewe must at least confess that the things which are represented to us insleep are like painted representations which can only have been formedas the counterparts of something real and true, and that in this way thosegeneral things at least, i.e. eyes, a head, hands, and a whole body, arenot imaginary things, but things really existent. For, as a matter of fact,painters, even when they study with the greatest skill to represent sirensand satyrs by forms the most strange and extraordinary, cannot give themnatures which are entirely new, but merely make a certain medley of themembers of different animals; or if their imagination is extravagant enoughto invent something so novel that nothing similar has ever before beenseen, and that then their work represents a thing purely fictitious andabsolutely false, it is certain all the same that the colours of whichthis is composed are necessarily real. And for the same reason, althoughthese general things, to with, [a body], eyes, a head, hands, and suchlike, may be imaginary, we are bound at the same time to confess that thereare at least some other objects yet more simple and more universal, whichare real and true; and of these just in the same way as with certain realcolours, all these images of things which dwell in our thoughts, whethertrue and real or false and fantastic, are formed. </P><P>To such a class of things pertains corporeal nature in general, andits extension, the figure of extended things, their quantity or magnitudeand number, as also the place in which they are, the time which measurestheir duration, and so on. </P><P>That is possibly why our reasoning is not unjust when we conclude fromthis that Physics, Astronomy, Medicine and all other sciences which haveas their end the consideration of composite things, are very dubious anduncertain; but that Arithmetic, Geometry and other sciences of that kindwhich only treat of things that are very simple and very general, withouttaking great trouble to ascertain whether they are actually existent ornot, contain some measure of certainty and an element of the indubitable.For whether I am awake or asleep, two and three together always form five,and the square can never have more than four sides, and it does not seempossible that truths so clear and apparent can be suspected of any falsity[or uncertainty]. </P><P>Nevertheless I have long had fixed in my mind the belief that an all-powerfulGod existed by whom I have been created such as I am. But how do I knowthat He has not brought it to pass that there is no earth, no heaven, noextended body, no magnitude, no place, and that nevertheless [I possessthe perceptions of all these things and that] they seem to me to existjust exactly as I now see them? And, besides, as I sometimes imagine thatothers deceive themselves in the things which they think they know best,how do I know that I am not deceived every time that I add two and three,or count the sides of a square, or judge of things yet simpler, if anythingsimpler can be imagined? But possibly God has not desired that I shouldbe thus deceived, for He is said to be supremely good. If, however, itis contrary to His goodness to have made me such that I constantly deceivemyself, it would also appear to be contrary to His goodness to permit meto be sometimes deceived, and nevertheless I cannot doubt that He doespermit this. </P><P>There may indeed be those who would prefer to deny the existence ofa God so powerful, rather than believe that all other things are uncertain.But let us not oppose them for the present, and grant that all that ishere said of a God is a fable; nevertheless in whatever way they supposethat I have arrived at the state of being that I have reached -- whetherthey attribute it to fate or to accident, or make out that it is by a continualsuccession of antecedents, or by some other method -- since to err anddeceive oneself is a defect, it is clear that the greater will be the probabilityof my being so imperfect as to deceive myself ever, as is the Author towhom they assign my origin the less powerful. To these reasons I have certainlynothing to reply, but at the end I feel constrained to confess that thereis nothing in all that I formerly believed to be true, of which I cannotin some measure doubt, and that not merely through want of thought or throughlevity, but for reasons which are very powerful and maturely considered;so that henceforth I ought not the less carefully to refrain from givingcredence to these opinions than to that which is manifestly false, if Idesire to arrive at any certainty [in the sciences]. </P><P>But it is not sufficient to have made these remarks, we must also becareful to keep them in mind. For these ancient and commonly held opinionsstill revert frequently to my mind, long and familiar custom having giventhem the right to occupy my mind against my inclination and rendered themalmost masters of my belief; nor will I ever lose the habit of deferringto them or of placing my confidence in them, so long as I consider themas they really are, i.e. opinions in some measure doubtful, as I have justshown, and at the same time highly probable, so that there is much morereason to believe in than to deny them. That is why I consider that I shallnot be acting amiss, if, taking of set purpose a contrary belief, I allowmyself to be deceived, and for a certain time pretend that all these opinionsare entirely false and imaginary, until at last, having thus balanced myformer prejudices with my latter [so that they cannot divert my opinionsmore to one side than to the other], my judgment will no longer be dominatedby bad usage or turned away from the right knowledge of the truth. ForI am assured that there can be neither peril nor error in this course,and that I cannot at present yield too much to distrust, since I am notconsidering the question of action, but only of knowledge. </P><P>I shall then suppose, not that God who is supremely good and the fountainof truth, but some evil genius not less powerful than deceitful, has employedhis whole energies in deceiving me; I shall consider that the heavens,the earth, colours, figures, sound, and all other external things are noughtbut the illusions and dreams of which this genius has availed himself inorder to lay traps for my credulity; I shall consider myself as havingno hands, no eyes, no flesh, no blood, nor any senses, yet falsely believingmyself to possess all these things; I shall remain obstinately attachedto this idea, and if by this means it is not in my power to arrive at theknowledge of any truth, I may at least do what is in my power [i.e. suspendmy judgment], and with firm purpose avoid giving credence to any falsething, or being imposed upon by this arch deceiver, however powerful anddeceptive he may be. But this task is a laborious one, and insensibly acertain lassitude leads me into the course of my ordinary life. And justas a captive who in sleep enjoys an imaginary liberty, when he begins tosuspect that his liberty is but a dream, fears to awaken, and conspireswith these agreeable illusions that the deception may be prolonged, soinsensibly of my own accord I fall back into my former opinions, and Idread awakening from this slumber, lest the laborious wakefulness whichwould follow the tranquillity of this repose should have to be spent notin daylight, but in the excessive darkness of the difficulties which havejust been discussed. </P><P><B>Meditation II: Of the Nature of the Human Mind; and that it is moreeasily known than the Body</B> </P><P>The Meditation of yesterday filled my mind with so many doubts thatit is no longer in my power to forget them. And yet I do not see in whatmanner I can resolve them; and, just as if I had all of a sudden falleninto very deep water, I am so disconcerted that I can neither make certainof setting my feet on the bottom, nor can I swim and so support myselfon the surface. I shall nevertheless make an effort and follow anew thesame path as that on which I yesterday entered, i.e. I shall proceed bysetting aside all that in which the least doubt could be supposed to exist,just as if I had discovered that it was absolutely false; and I shall everfollow in this road until I have met with something which is certain, orat least, if I can do nothing else, until I have learned for certain thatthere is nothing in the world that is certain. Archimedes, in order thathe might draw the terrestrial globe out of its place, and transport itelsewhere, demanded only that one point should be fixed and immoveable;in the same way I shall have the right to conceive high hopes if I am happyenough to discover one thing only which is certain and indubitable. </P><P>I suppose, then, that all the things that I see are false; I persuademyself that nothing has ever existed of all that my fallacious memory representsto me. I consider that I possess no senses; I imagine that body, figure,extension, movement and place are but the fictions of my mind. What, then,can be esteemed as true? Perhaps nothing at all, unless that there is nothingin the world that is certain. </P><P>But how can I know there is not something different from those thingsthat I have just considered, of which one cannot have the slightest doubt?Is there not some God, or some other being by whatever name we call it,who puts these reflections into my mind? That is not necessary, for isit not possible that I am capable of producing them myself? I myself, amI not at least something? But I have already denied that I had senses andbody. Yet I hesitate, for what follows from that? Am I so dependent onbody and senses that I cannot exist without these? But I was persuadedthat there was nothing in all the world, that there was no heaven, no earth,that there were no minds, nor any bodies: was I not then likewise persuadedthat I did not exist? Not at all; of a surety I myself did exist sinceI persuaded myself of something [or merely because I thought of something].But there is some deceiver or other, very powerful and very cunning, whoever employs his ingenuity in deceiving me. Then without doubt I existalso if he deceives me, and let him deceive me as much as he will, he cannever cause me to be nothing so long as I think that I am something. Sothat after having reflected well and carefully examined all things, wemust come to the definite conclusion that this proposition: I am, I exist,is necessarily true each time that I pronounce it, or that I mentally conceiveit. </P><P>But I do not yet know clearly enough what I am, I who am certain thatI am; and hence I must be careful to see that I do not imprudently takesome other object in place of myself, and thus that I do not go astrayin respect of this knowledge that I hold to be the most certain and mostevident of all that I have formerly learned. That is why I shall now consideranew what I believed myself to be before I embarked upon these last reflections;and of my former opinions I shall withdraw all that might even in a smalldegree be invalidated by the reasons which I have just brought forward,in order that there may be nothing at all left beyond what is absolutelycertain and indubitable. </P><P>What then did I formerly believe myself to be? Undoubtedly I believedmyself to be a man. But what is a man? Shall I say a reasonable animal?Certainly not; for then I should have to inquire what an animal is, andwhat is reasonable; and thus from a single question I should insensiblyfall into an infinitude of others more difficult; and I should not wishto waste the little time and leisure remaining to me in trying to unravelsubtleties like these. But I shall rather stop here to consider the thoughtswhich of themselves spring up in my mind, and which were not inspired byanything beyond my own nature alone when I applied myself to the considerationof my being. In the first place, the, I considered myself as having a face,hands, arms, and all that system of members composed on bones and fleshas seen in a corpse which I designated by the name of body. In additionto this I considered that I was nourished, that I walked, that I felt,and that I thought, and I referred all these actions to the soul: but Idid not stop to consider what the soul was, or if I did stop, I imaginedthat it was something extremely rare and subtle like a wind, a flame, oran ether, which was spread throughout my grosser parts. As to body I hadno manner of doubt about its nature, but thought I had a very clear knowledgeof it; and if I had desired to explain it according to the notions thatI had then formed of it, I should have described it thus: By the body Iunderstand all that which can be defined by a certain figure: somethingwhich can be confined in a certain place, and which can fill a given spacein such a way that every other body will be excluded from it; which canbe perceived either by tough, or by sight, or by hearing, or by taste,or by smell: which can be moved in many ways not, in truth, by itself,but by something which is foreign to it, by which it is touched [and fromwhich it receives impressions]: for to have the power of self-movement,as also of feeling or of thinking, I did not consider to appertain to thenature of body: on the contrary, I was rather astonished to find that facultiessimilar to them existed in some bodies. </P><P>But what am I, now that I suppose that there is a certain genius whichis extremely powerful, and, if I may say so, malicious, who employs allhis powers in deceiving me? Can I affirm that I possess the least of allthose things which I have just said pertain to the nature of body? I pauseto consider, I revolve all these things in my mind, and I find none ofwhich I can say that it pertains to me. It would be tedious to stop toenumerate them. Let us pass to the attributes of soul and see if thereis any one which is in me? What of nutrition or walking [the first mentioned]?But if it is so that I have no body it is also true that I can neitherwalk nor take nourishment. Another attribute is sensation. But one cannotfeel without body, and besides I have thought I perceived many things duringsleep that I recognised in my waking moments as not having been experiencedat all. What of thinking? I find here that thought is an attribute thatbelongs to me; it alone cannot be separated from me. I am, I exist, thatis certain. But how often? Just when I think; for it might possibly bethe case if I ceased entirely to think, that I should likewise cease altogetherto exist. I do not now admit anything which is not necessarily true: tospeak accurately I am not more than a thing which thinks, that is to saya mind or a soul, or an understanding, or a reason, which are terms whosesignificance was formerly unknown to me. I am, however, a real thing andreally exist; but what thing? I have answered: a thing which thinks. </P><P>And what more? I shall exercise my imagination [in order to see if Iam not something more]. I am not a collection of members which we callthe human body: I am not a subtle air distributed through these members,I am not a wind, a fire, a vapour, a breath, nor anything at all whichI can imagine or conceive; because I have assumed that all these were nothing.Without changing that supposition I find that I only leave myself certainof the fact that I am somewhat. But perhaps it is true that these samethings which I supposed were non-existent because they are unknown to me,are really not different from the self which I know. I am not sure aboutthis, I shall not dispute about it now; I can only give judgment on thingsthat are known to me. I know that I exist, and I inquire what I am, I whomI know to exist. But it is very certain that the knowledge of my existencetaken in its precise significance does not depend on things whose existenceis not yet known to me; consequently it does not depend on those whichI can feign in imagination. And indeed the very term feign in imagination10proves to me my error, for I really do this if I image myself a something,since to imagine is nothing else than to contemplate the figure or imageof a corporeal thing. But I already know for certain that I am, and thatit may be that all these images, and, speaking generally, all things thatrelate to the nature of body are nothing but dreams [and chimeras]. Forthis reason I see clearly that I have as little reason to say, I shallstimulate my imagination in order to know more distinctly what I am, thanif I were to say, I am now awake, and I perceive somewhat that is realand true: but because I do not yet perceive it distinctly enough, I shallgo to sleep of express purpose, so that my dreams may represent the perceptionwith greatest truth and evidence. And, thus, I know for certain that nothingof all that I can understand by means of my imagination belongs to thisknowledge which I have of myself, and that it is necessary to recall themind from this mode of thought with the utmost diligence in order thatit may be able to know its own nature with perfect distinctness. </P><P>But what then am I? A thing which thinks. What is a thing which thinks?It is a thing which doubts, understands, [conceives], affirms, denies,wills, refuses, which also imagines and feels. </P><P>Certainly it is no small matter if all these things pertain to my nature.But why should they not so pertain? Am I not that being who now doubtsnearly everything, who nevertheless understands certain things, who affirmsthat one only is true, who denies all the others, who desires to know more,is averse from being deceived, who imagines many things, sometimes indeeddespite his will, and who perceives many likewise, as by the interventionof the bodily organs? Is there nothing in all this which is as true asit is certain that I exist, even though I should always sleep and thoughhe who has given me being employed all his ingenuity in deceiving me? Isthere likewise any one of these attributes which can be distinguished frommy thought, or which might be said to be separated from myself? For itis so evident of itself that it is I who doubts, who understands, and whodesires, that there is no reason here to add anything to explain it. AndI have certainly the power of imagining likewise; for although it may happen(as I formerly supposed) that none of the things which I imagine are true,nevertheless this power of imagining does not cease to be really in use,and it forms part of my thought. Finally, I am the same who feels, thatis to say, who perceives certain things, as by the organs of sense, sinceit truth I see light, I hear noise, I feel heat. But it will be said thatthese phenomena are false and that I am dreaming. Let it be so; still itis at least quite certain that it seems to me that I see light, that Ihear noise and that I feel heat. That cannot be false; properly speakingit is what is in me called feeling;11 and used in this precise sense thatis no other thing than thinking. </P><P>From this time I begin to know what I am with a little more clearnessand distinction than before; but nevertheless it still seems to me, andI cannot prevent myself from thinking, that corporeal things, whose imagesare framed by thought, which are tested by the senses, are much more distinctlyknown than that obscure part of me which does not come under the imagination.Although really it is very strange to say that I know and understand moredistinctly these things whose existence seems to me dubious, which areunknown to me, and which do not belong to me, than others of the truthof which I am convinced, which are known to me and which pertain to myreal nature, in a word, than myself. But I see clearly how the case stands:my mind loves to wander, and cannot yet suffer itself to be retained withinthe just limits of truth. Very good, let us once more give it the freestrein, so that, when afterwards we seize the proper occasion for pullingup, it may the more easily be regulated and controlled.</P><P>Let us begin by considering the commonest matters, those which we believeto be the most distinctly comprehended, to wit, the bodies which we touchand see; not indeed bodies in general, for these general ideas are usuallya little more confused, but let us consider one body in particular. Letus take, for example, this piece of wax: it has been taken quite freshlyfrom the hive, and it has not yet lost the sweetness of the honey whichit contains; it still retains somewhat of the odour of the flowers fromwhich it has been culled; its colour, its figure, its size are apparent;it is hard, cold, easily handled, and if you strike it with the finger,it will emit a sound. Finally all the things which are requisite to causeus distinctly to recognise a body, are met with in it. But notice thatwhile I speak and approach the fire what remained of the taste is exhaled,the smell evaporates, the colour alters, the figure is destroyed, the sizeincreases, it becomes liquid, it heats, scarcely can one handle it, andwhen one strikes it, now sound is emitted. Does the same wax remain afterthis change? We must confess that it remains; none would judge otherwise.What then did I know so distinctly in this piece of wax? It could certainlybe nothing of all that the senses brought to my notice, since all thesethings which fall under taste, smell, sight, touch, and hearing, are foundto be changed, and yet the same wax remains. </P><P>Perhaps it was what I now think, viz. that this wax was not that sweetnessof honey, nor that agreeable scent of flowers, nor that particular whiteness,nor that figure, nor that sound, but simply a body which a little whilebefore appeared tome as perceptible under these forms, and which is nowperceptible under others. But what, precisely, is it that I imagine whenI form such conceptions? Let us attentively consider this, and, abstractingfrom all that does not belong to the wax, let us see what remains. Certainlynothing remains excepting a certain extended thing which is flexible andmovable. But what is the meaning of flexible and movable? Is it not thatI imagine that this piece of wax being round is capable of becoming squareand of passing from a square to a triangular figure? No, certainly it isnot that, since I imagine it admits of an infinitude of similar changes,and I nevertheless do not know how to compass the infinitude by my imagination,and consequently this conception which I have of the wax is not broughtabout by the faculty of imagination. What now is this extension? Is itnot also unknown? For it becomes greater when the wax is melted, greaterwhen it is boiled, and greater still when the heat increases; and I shouldnot conceive [clearly] according to truth what wax is, if I did not thinkthat even this piece that we are considering is capable of receiving morevariations in extension than I have ever imagined. We must then grant thatI could not even understand through the imagination what this piece ofwax is, and that it is my mind12 alone which perceives it. I say this pieceof wax in particular, for as to wax in general it is yet clearer. But whatis this piece of wax which cannot be understood excepting by the [understandingor] mind? It is certainly the same that I see, touch, imagine, and finallyit is the same which I have always believed it to be from the beginning.But what must particularly be observed is that its perception is neitheran act of vision, nor of touch, nor of imagination, and has never beensuch although it may have appeared formerly to be so, but only an intuition13of the mind, which may be imperfect and confused as it was formerly, orclear and distinct as it is at present, according as my attention is moreor less directed to the elements which are found in it, and of which itis composed. </P><P>Yet in the meantime I am greatly astonished when I consider [the greatfeebleness of mind] and its proneness to fall [insensibly] into error;for although without giving expression to my thought I consider all thisin my own mind, words often impede me and I am almost deceived by the termsof ordinary language. For we say that we see the same wax, if it is present,and not that we simply judge that it is the same from its having the samecolour and figure. From this I should conclude that I knew the wax by meansof vision and not simply by the intuition of the mind; unless by chanceI remember that, when looking from a window and saying I see men who passin the street, I really do not see them, but infer that what I see is men,just as I say that I see wax. And yet what do I see from the window buthats and coats which may cover automatic machines? Yet I judge these tobe men. And similarly solely by the faculty of judgment which rests inmy mind, I comprehend that which I believed I saw with my eyes. </P><P>A man who makes it his aim to raise his knowledge above the common shouldbe ashamed to derive the occasion for doubting from the forms of speechinvented by the vulgar; I prefer to pass on and consider whether I hada more evident and perfect conception of what the wax was when I firstperceived it, and when I believed I knew it by means of the external sensesor at least by the common sense14 as it is called, that is to say by theimaginative faculty, or whether my present conception is clearer now thatI have most carefully examined what it is, and in what way it can be known.It would certainly be absurd to doubt as to this. For what was there inthis first perception which was distinct? What was there which might notas well have been perceived by any of the animals? But when I distinguishthe wax from its external forms, and when, just as if I had taken fromit its vestments, I consider it quite naked, it is certain that althoughsome error may still be found in my judgment, I can nevertheless not perceiveit thus without a human mind. </P><P>But finally what shall I say of this mind, that is, of myself, for upto this point I do not admit in myself anything but mind? What then, Iwho seem to perceive this piece of wax so distinctly, do I not know myself,not only with much more truth and certainty, but also with much more distinctnessand clearness? For if I judge that the wax is or exists from the fact thatI see it, it certainly follows much more clearly that I am or that I existmyself from the fact that I see it. For it may be that what I see is notreally wax, it may also be that I do not possess eyes with which to seeanything; but it cannot be that when I see, or (for I no longer take accountof the distinction) when I think I see, that I myself who think am nought.So if I judge that the wax exists from the fact that I touch it, the samething will follow, to wit, that I am; and if I judge that my imagination,or some other cause, whatever it is, persuades me that the wax exists,I shall still conclude the same. And what I have here remarked of wax maybe applied to all other things which are external to me [and which aremet with outside of me]. And further, if the [notion or] perception ofwax has seemed to me clearer and more distinct, not only after the sightor the touch, but also after many other causes have rendered it quite manifestto me, with how much more [evidence] and distinctness must it be said thatI now know myself, since all the reasons which contribute to the knowledgeof wax, or any other body whatever, are yet better proofs of the natureof my mind! And there are so many other things in the mind itself whichmay contribute to the elucidation of its nature, that those which dependon body such as these just mentioned, hardly merit being taken into account.</P><P>But finally here I am, having insensibly reverted to the point I desired,for, since it is now manifest to me that even bodies are not properly speakingknown by the senses or by the faculty of imagination, but by the understandingonly, and since they are not known from the fact that they are seen ortouched, but only because they are understood, I see clearly that thereis nothing which is easier for me to know than my mind. But because itis difficult to rid oneself so promptly of an opinion to which one wasaccustomed for so long, it will be well that I should halt a little atthis point, so that by the length of my meditation I may more deeply imprinton my memory this new knowledge. </P></BODY></HTML>
