<br>&nbsp; CEBES
<br>&nbsp; CRITO

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SCENE: The Prison of Socrates
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PLACE OF THE NARRATION: Phlius
<br>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>(Intorductory argument)</b>
<br>&nbsp; Echecrates. Were you yourself, Phaedo, in the prison with Socrates
<br>on the day when he drank the poison?
<br>&nbsp; Phaedo. Yes, Echecrates, I was.
<br>&nbsp; Ech. I wish that you would tell me about his death. What did
he
<br>say in his last hours? We were informed that he died by taking poison,
<br>but no one knew anything more; for no Phliasian ever goes to Athens
<br>now, and a long time has elapsed since any Athenian found his way to
<br>Phlius, and therefore we had no clear account.
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. Did you not hear of the proceedings at the trial?
<br>&nbsp; Ech. Yes; someone told us about the trial, and we could not
<br>understand why, having been condemned, he was put to death, as
<br>appeared, not at the time, but long afterwards. What was the reason
of
<br>this?
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. An accident, Echecrates. The reason was that the stern
of the
<br>ship which the Athenians send to Delos happened to have been crowned
<br>on the day before he was tried.
<br>&nbsp; Ech. What is this ship?
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. This is the ship in which, as the Athenians say, Theseus
went
<br>to Crete when he took with him the fourteen youths, and was the
<br>saviour of them and of himself. And they were said to have vowed to
<br>Apollo at the time, that if they were saved they would make an
<br>annual pilgrimage to Delos. Now this custom still continues, and the
<br>whole period of the voyage to and from Delos, beginning when the
<br>priest of Apollo crowns the stern of the ship, is a holy season,
<br>during which the city is not allowed to be polluted by public
<br>executions; and often, when the vessel is detained by adverse winds,
<br>there may be a very considerable delay. As I was saying, the ship
<br>was crowned on the day before the trial, and this was the reason why
<br>Socrates lay in prison and was not put to death until long after he
<br>was condemned.
<br>&nbsp; Ech. What was the manner of his death, Phaedo? What was said
or
<br>done? And which of his friends had he with him? Or were they not
<br>allowed by the authorities to be present? And did he die alone?
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. No; there were several of his friends with him.
<br>&nbsp; Ech. If you have nothing to do, I wish that you would tell me
what
<br>passed, as exactly as you can.
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. I have nothing to do, and will try to gratify your wish.
<br>For to me, too, there is no greater pleasure than to have Socrates
<br>brought to my recollection, whether I speak myself or hear another
<br>speak of him.
<br>&nbsp; Ech. You will have listeners who are of the same mind with you,
<br>and I hope that you will be as exact as you can.
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. I remember the strange feeling which came over me at
being
<br>with him. For I could hardly believe that I was present at the death
<br>of a friend, and therefore I did not pity him, Echecrates; his mien
<br>and his language were so noble and fearless in the hour of death
<br>that to me he appeared blessed. I thought that in going to the other
<br>world he could not be without a divine call, and that he would be
<br>happy, if any man ever was, when he arrived there, and therefore I
did
<br>not pity him as might seem natural at such a time. But neither could
I
<br>feel the pleasure which I usually felt in philosophical discourse (for
<br>philosophy was the theme of which we spoke). I was pleased, and I
<br>was also pained, because I knew that he was soon to die, and this
<br>strange mixture of feeling was shared by us all; we were laughing
<br>and weeping by turns, especially the excitable Apollodorus-you know
<br>the sort of man?
<br>&nbsp; Ech. Yes.
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. He was quite overcome; and I myself and all of us were
<br>greatly moved.
<br>&nbsp; Ech. Who were present?
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. Of native Athenians there were, besides Apollodorus,
<br>Critobulus and his father Crito, Hermogenes, Epigenes, Aeschines,
<br>and Antisthenes; likewise Ctesippus of the deme of Paeania, Menexenus,
<br>and some others; but Plato, if I am not mistaken, was ill.
<br>&nbsp; Ech. Were there any strangers?
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. Yes, there were; Simmias the Theban, and Cebes, and
<br>Phaedondes; Euclid and Terpison, who came from Megara.
<br>&nbsp; Ech. And was Aristippus there, and Cleombrotus?
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. No, they were said to be in Aegina.
<br>&nbsp; Ech. Anyone else?
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. I think that these were about all.
<br>&nbsp; Ech. And what was the discourse of which you spoke?
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. I will begin at the beginning, and endeavor to repeat
the
<br>entire conversation. You must understand that we had been previously
<br>in the habit of assembling early in the morning at the court in
<br>which the trial was held, and which is not far from the prison.
<br>There we remained talking with one another until the opening of the
<br>prison doors (for they were not opened very early), and then went in
<br>and generally passed the day with Socrates. On the last morning the
<br>meeting was earlier than usual; this was owing to our having heard
<br>on the previous evening that the sacred ship had arrived from Delos,
<br>and therefore we agreed to meet very early at the accustomed place.
On
<br>our going to the prison, the jailer who answered the door, instead
<br>of admitting us, came out and bade us wait and he would call us.
<br>"For the Eleven," he said, "are now with Socrates; they are taking
off
<br>his chains, and giving orders that he is to die to-day." He soon
<br>returned and said that we might come in. On entering we found Socrates
<br>just released from chains, and Xanthippe, whom you know, sitting by
<br>him, and holding his child in her arms. When she saw us she uttered
<br>a cry and said, as women will: "O Socrates, this is the last time that
<br>either you will converse with your friends, or they with you."
<br>Socrates turned to Crito and said: "Crito, let someone take her home."
<br>Some of Crito's people accordingly led her away, crying out and
<br>beating herself. And when she was gone, Socrates, sitting up on the
<br>couch, began to bend and rub his leg, saying, as he rubbed: "How
<br>singular is the thing called pleasure, and how curiously related to
<br>pain, which might be thought to be the opposite of it; for they
<br>never come to a man together, and yet he who pursues either of them
is
<br>generally compelled to take the other. They are two, and yet they grow
<br>together out of one head or stem; and I cannot help thinking that if
<br>Aesop had noticed them, he would have made a fable about God trying
to
<br>reconcile their strife, and when he could not, he fastened their heads
<br>together; and this is the reason why when one comes the other follows,
<br>as I find in my own case pleasure comes following after the pain in
my
<br>leg, which was caused by the chain."
<br>&nbsp; Upon this Cebes said: I am very glad indeed, Socrates, that
you
<br>mentioned the name of Aesop. For that reminds me of a question which
<br>has been asked by others, and was asked of me only the day before
<br>yesterday by Evenus the poet, and as he will be sure to ask again,
you
<br>may as well tell me what I should say to him, if you would like him
to
<br>have an answer. He wanted to know why you who never before wrote a
<br>line of poetry, now that you are in prison are putting Aesop into
<br>verse, and also composing that hymn in honor of Apollo.
<br>&nbsp; Tell him, Cebes, he replied, that I had no idea of rivalling
him
<br>or his poems; which is the truth, for I knew that I could not do that.
<br>But I wanted to see whether I could purge away a scruple which I
<br>felt about certain dreams. In the course of my life I have often had
<br>intimations in dreams "that I should make music." The same dream
<br>came to me sometimes in one form, and sometimes in another, but always
<br>saying the same or nearly the same words: Make and cultivate music,
<br>said the dream. And hitherto I had imagined that this was only
<br>intended to exhort and encourage me in the study of philosophy,
<br>which has always been the pursuit of my life, and is the noblest and
<br>best of music. The dream was bidding me to do what I was already
<br>doing, in the same way that the competitor in a race is bidden by
<br>the spectators to run when he is already running. But I was not
<br>certain of this, as the dream might have meant music in the popular
<br>sense of the word, and being under sentence of death, and the festival
<br>giving me a respite, I thought that I should be safer if I satisfied
<br>the scruple, and, in obedience to the dream, composed a few verses
<br>before I departed. And first I made a hymn in honor of the god of
<br>the festival, and then considering that a poet, if he is really to
<br>be a poet or maker, should not only put words together but make
<br>stories, and as I have no invention, I took some fables of esop, which
<br>I had ready at hand and knew, and turned them into verse. Tell
<br>Evenus this, and bid him be of good cheer; that I would have him
<br>come after me if he be a wise man, and not tarry; and that to-day I
am
<br>likely to be going, for the Athenians say that I must.
<br>&nbsp; Simmias said: What a message for such a man! having been a
<br>frequent companion of his, I should say that, as far as I know him,
he
<br>will never take your advice unless he is obliged.
<br>&nbsp; Why, said Socrates,-is not Evenus a philosopher?
<br>&nbsp; I think that he is, said Simmias.
<br>&nbsp; Then he, or any man who has the spirit of philosophy, will be
<br>willing to die, though he will not take his own life, for that is held
<br>not to be right.
<br>&nbsp; Here he changed his position, and put his legs off the couch
on to
<br>the ground, and during the rest of the conversation he remained
<br>sitting.
<br>&nbsp; Why do you say, inquired Cebes, that a man ought not to take
his own
<br>life, but that the philosopher will be ready to follow the dying?
<br>&nbsp; Socrates replied: And have you, Cebes and Simmias, who are
<br>acquainted with Philolaus, never heard him speak of this?
<br>&nbsp; I never understood him, Socrates.
<br>&nbsp; My words, too, are only an echo; but I am very willing to say
what I
<br>have heard: and indeed, as I am going to another place, I ought to
<br>be thinking and talking of the nature of the pilgrimage which I am
<br>about to make. What can I do better in the interval between this and
<br>the setting of the sun?
<br>&nbsp; Then tell me, Socrates, why is suicide held not to be right?
as I
<br>have certainly heard Philolaus affirm when he was staying with us at
<br>Thebes: and there are others who say the same, although none of them
<br>has ever made me understand him.
<br>&nbsp; But do your best, replied Socrates, and the day may come when
you
<br>will understand. I suppose that you wonder why, as most things which
<br>are evil may be accidentally good, this is to be the only exception
<br>(for may not death, too, be better than life in some cases?), and why,
<br>when a man is better dead, he is not permitted to be his own
<br>benefactor, but must wait for the hand of another.
<br>&nbsp; By Jupiter! yes, indeed, said Cebes, laughing, and speaking
in his
<br>native Doric.
<br>&nbsp; I admit the appearance of inconsistency, replied Socrates, but
there
<br>may not be any real inconsistency after all in this. There is a
<br>doctrine uttered in secret that man is a prisoner who has no right
<br>to open the door of his prison and run away; this is a great mystery
<br>which I do not quite understand. Yet I, too, believe that the gods
are
<br>our guardians, and that we are a possession of theirs. Do you not
<br>agree?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, I agree to that, said Cebes.
<br>&nbsp; And if one of your own possessions, an ox or an ass, for example
<br>took the liberty of putting himself out of the way when you had
<br>given no intimation of your wish that he should die, would you not
<br>be angry with him, and would you not punish him if you could?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly, replied Cebes.
<br>&nbsp; Then there may be reason in saying that a man should wait, and
not
<br>take his own life until God summons him, as he is now summoning me.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, Socrates, said Cebes, there is surely reason in that. And
yet
<br>how can you reconcile this seemingly true belief that God is our
<br>guardian and we his possessions, with that willingness to die which
we
<br>were attributing to the philosopher? That the wisest of men should
<br>be willing to leave this service in which they are ruled by the gods
<br>who are the best of rulers is not reasonable, for surely no wise man
<br>thinks that when set at liberty he can take better care of himself
<br>than the gods take of him. A fool may perhaps think this-he may
<br>argue that he had better run away from his master, not considering
<br>that his duty is to remain to the end, and not to run away from the
<br>good, and that there is no sense in his running away. But the wise
man
<br>will want to be ever with him who is better than himself. Now this,
<br>Socrates, is the reverse of what was just now said; for upon this view
<br>the wise man should sorrow and the fool rejoice at passing out of
<br>life.
<br>&nbsp; The earnestness of Cebes seemed to please Socrates. Here, said
he,
<br>turning to us, is a man who is always inquiring, and is not to be
<br>convinced all in a moment, nor by every argument.
<br>&nbsp; And in this case, added Simmias, his objection does appear to
me
<br>to have some force. For what can be the meaning of a truly wise man
<br>wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better than
<br>himself? And I rather imagine that Cebes is referring to you; he
<br>thinks that you are too ready to leave us, and too ready to leave
<br>the gods who, as you acknowledge, are our good rulers.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, replied Socrates; there is reason in that. And this
<br>indictment you think that I ought to answer as if I were in court?
<br>&nbsp; That is what we should like, said Simmias.
<br>&nbsp; Then I must try to make a better impression upon you than I
did when
<br>defending myself before the judges. For I am quite ready to
<br>acknowledge, Simmias and Cebes, that I ought to be grieved at death,
<br>if I were not persuaded that I am going to other gods who are wise
and
<br>good (of this I am as certain as I can be of anything of the sort)
and
<br>to men departed (though I am not so certain of this), who are better
<br>than those whom I leave behind; and therefore I do not grieve as I
<br>might have done, for I have good hope that there is yet something
<br>remaining for the dead, and, as has been said of old, some far
<br>better thing for the good than for the evil.
<br>&nbsp; But do you mean to take away your thoughts with you, Socrates?
<br>said Simmias. Will you not communicate them to us?-the benefit is
<br>one in which we too may hope to share. Moreover, if you succeed in
<br>convincing us, that will be an answer to the charge against yourself.
<br>&nbsp; I will do my best, replied Socrates. But you must first let
me
<br>hear what Crito wants; he was going to say something to me.
<br>&nbsp; Only this, Socrates, replied Crito: the attendant who is to
give you
<br>the poison has been telling me that you are not to talk much, and he
<br>wants me to let you know this; for that by talking heat is
<br>increased, and this interferes with the action of the poison; those
<br>who excite themselves are sometimes obliged to drink the poison two
or
<br>three times.
<br>&nbsp; Then, said Socrates, let him mind his business and be prepared
to
<br>give the poison two or three times, if necessary; that is all.
<br>&nbsp; I was almost certain that you would say that, replied Crito;
but I
<br>was obliged to satisfy him.
<br>&nbsp; Never mind him, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And now I will make answer to you, O my judges, and show that
he who
<br>has lived as a true philosopher has reason to be of good cheer when
he
<br>is about to die, and that after death he may hope to receive the
<br>greatest good in the other world. And how this may be, Simmias and
<br>Cebes, I will endeavor to explain. For I deem that the true disciple
<br>of philosophy is likely to be misunderstood by other men; they do
<br>not perceive that he is ever pursuing death and dying; and if this
<br>is true, why, having had the desire of death all his life long, should
<br>he repine at the arrival of that which he has been always pursuing
and
<br>desiring?
<br>&nbsp; Simmias laughed and said: Though not in a laughing humor, I
swear
<br>that I cannot help laughing when I think what the wicked world will
<br>say when they hear this. They will say that this is very true, and
our
<br>people at home will agree with them in saying that the life which
<br>philosophers desire is truly death, and that they have found them
<br>out to be deserving of the death which they desire.
<br>&nbsp; And they are right, Simmias, in saying this, with the exception
of
<br>the words "They have found them out"; for they have not found out what
<br>is the nature of this death which the true philosopher desires, or
how
<br>he deserves or desires death. But let us leave them and have a word
<br>with ourselves: Do we believe that there is such a thing as death?
<br>&nbsp; To be sure, replied Simmias.
<br>&nbsp; And is this anything but the separation of soul and body? And
<br>being dead is the attainment of this separation; when the soul
<br>exists in herself, and is parted from the body and the body is
<br>parted from the soul-that is death?
<br>&nbsp; Exactly: that and nothing else, he replied.
<br>&nbsp; And what do you say of another question, my friend, about which
I
<br>should like to have your opinion, and the answer to which will
<br>probably throw light on our present inquiry: Do you think that the
<br>philosopher ought to care about the pleasures-if they are to be called
<br>pleasures-of eating and drinking?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly not, answered Simmias.
<br>&nbsp; And what do you say of the pleasures of love-should he care
about
<br>them?
<br>&nbsp; By no means.
<br>&nbsp; And will he think much of the other ways of indulging the body-for
<br>example, the acquisition of costly raiment, or sandals, or other
<br>adornments of the body? Instead of caring about them, does he not
<br>rather despise anything more than nature needs? What do you say?
<br>&nbsp; I should say the true philosopher would despise them.
<br>&nbsp; Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul
and
<br>not with the body? He would like, as far as he can, to be quit of
<br>the body and turn to the soul.
<br>&nbsp; That is true.
<br>&nbsp; In matters of this sort philosophers, above all other men, may
be
<br>observed in every sort of way to dissever the soul from the body.
<br>&nbsp; That is true.
<br>&nbsp; Whereas, Simmias, the rest of the world are of opinion that
a life
<br>which has no bodily pleasures and no part in them is not worth having;
<br>but that he who thinks nothing of bodily pleasures is almost as though
<br>he were dead.
<br>&nbsp; That is quite true.
<br>&nbsp; What again shall we say of the actual acquirement of knowledge?-is
<br>the body, if invited to share in the inquiry, a hinderer or a
<br>helper? I mean to say, have sight and hearing any truth in them? Are
<br>they not, as the poets are always telling us, inaccurate witnesses?
<br>and yet, if even they are inaccurate and indistinct, what is to be
<br>said of the other senses?-for you will allow that they are the best
of
<br>them?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly, he replied.
<br>&nbsp; Then when does the soul attain truth?-for in attempting to
<br>consider anything in company with the body she is obviously deceived.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, that is true.
<br>&nbsp; Then must not existence be revealed to her in thought, if at
all?
<br>&nbsp; Yes.
<br>&nbsp; And thought is best when the mind is gathered into herself and
<br>none of these things trouble her-neither sounds nor sights nor pain
<br>nor any pleasure-when she has as little as possible to do with the
<br>body, and has no bodily sense or feeling, but is aspiring after being?
<br>&nbsp; That is true.
<br>&nbsp; And in this the philosopher dishonors the body; his soul runs
away
<br>from the body and desires to be alone and by herself?
<br>&nbsp; That is true.
<br>&nbsp; Well, but there is another thing, Simmias: Is there or is there
<br>not an absolute justice?
<br>&nbsp; Assuredly there is.
<br>&nbsp; And an absolute beauty and absolute good?
<br>&nbsp; Of course.
<br>&nbsp; But did you ever behold any of them with your eyes?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly not.
<br>&nbsp; Or did you ever reach them with any other bodily sense? (and
I speak
<br>not of these alone, but of absolute greatness, and health, and
<br>strength, and of the essence or true nature of everything). Has the
<br>reality of them ever been perceived by you through the bodily
<br>organs? or rather, is not the nearest approach to the knowledge of
<br>their several natures made by him who so orders his intellectual
<br>vision as to have the most exact conception of the essence of that
<br>which he considers?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly.
<br>&nbsp; And he attains to the knowledge of them in their highest purity
<br>who goes to each of them with the mind alone, not allowing when in
the
<br>act of thought the intrusion or introduction of sight or any other
<br>sense in the company of reason, but with the very light of the mind
in
<br>her clearness penetrates into the very fight of truth in each; he
<br>has got rid, as far as he can, of eyes and ears and of the whole body,
<br>which he conceives of only as a disturbing element, hindering the soul
<br>from the acquisition of knowledge when in company with her-is not this
<br>the sort of man who, if ever man did, is likely to attain the
<br>knowledge of existence?
<br>&nbsp; There is admirable truth in that, Socrates, replied Simmias.
<br>&nbsp; And when they consider all this, must not true philosophers
make a
<br>reflection, of which they will speak to one another in such words as
<br>these: We have found, they will say, a path of speculation which seems
<br>to bring us and the argument to the conclusion that while we are in
<br>the body, and while the soul is mingled with this mass of evil, our
<br>desire will not be satisfied, and our desire is of the truth. For
<br>the body is a source of endless trouble to us by reason of the mere
<br>requirement of food; and also is liable to diseases which overtake
and
<br>impede us in the search after truth: and by filling us so full of
<br>loves, and lusts, and fears, and fancies, and idols, and every sort
of
<br>folly, prevents our ever having, as people say, so much as a
<br>thought. For whence come wars, and fightings, and factions? whence
but
<br>from the body and the lusts of the body? For wars are occasioned by
<br>the love of money, and money has to be acquired for the sake and in
<br>the service of the body; and in consequence of all these things the
<br>time which ought to be given to philosophy is lost. Moreover, if there
<br>is time and an inclination toward philosophy, yet the body
<br>introduces a turmoil and confusion and fear into the course of
<br>speculation, and hinders us from seeing the truth: and all
<br>experience shows that if we would have pure knowledge of anything we
<br>must be quit of the body, and the soul in herself must behold all
<br>things in themselves: then I suppose that we shall attain that which
<br>we desire, and of which we say that we are lovers, and that is wisdom,
<br>not while we live, but after death, as the argument shows; for if
<br>while in company with the body the soul cannot have pure knowledge,
<br>one of two things seems to follow-either knowledge is not to be
<br>attained at all, or, if at all, after death. For then, and not till
<br>then, the soul will be in herself alone and without the body. In
<br>this present life, I reckon that we make the nearest approach to
<br>knowledge when we have the least possible concern or interest in the
<br>body, and are not saturated with the bodily nature, but remain pure
<br>until the hour when God himself is pleased to release us. And then
the
<br>foolishness of the body will be cleared away and we shall be pure
<br>and hold converse with other pure souls, and know of ourselves the
<br>clear light everywhere; and this is surely the light of truth. For
<br>no impure thing is allowed to approach the pure. These are the sort
of
<br>words, Simmias, which the true lovers of wisdom cannot help saying
<br>to one another, and thinking. You will agree with me in that?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly, Socrates.
<br>&nbsp; But if this is true, O my friend, then there is great hope that,
<br>going whither I go, I shall there be satisfied with that which has
<br>been the chief concern of you and me in our past lives. And now that
<br>the hour of departure is appointed to me, this is the hope with
<br>which I depart, and not I only, but every man who believes that he
has
<br>his mind purified.
<br>&nbsp; Certainly, replied Simmias.
<br>&nbsp; And what is purification but the separation of the soul from
the
<br>body, as I was saying before; the habit of the soul gathering and
<br>collecting herself into herself, out of all the courses of the body;
<br>the dwelling in her own place alone, as in another life, so also in
<br>this, as far as she can; the release of the soul from the chains of
<br>the body?
<br>&nbsp; Very true, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And what is that which is termed death, but this very separation
and
<br>release of the soul from the body?
<br>&nbsp; To be sure, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And the true philosophers, and they only, study and are eager
to
<br>release the soul. Is not the separation and release of the soul from
<br>the body their especial study?
<br>&nbsp; That is true.
<br>&nbsp; And as I was saying at first, there would be a ridiculous
<br>contradiction in men studying to live as nearly as they can in a state
<br>of death, and yet repining when death comes.
<br>&nbsp; Certainly.
<br>&nbsp; Then, Simmias, as the true philosophers are ever studying death,
<br>to them, of all men, death is the least terrible. Look at the matter
<br>in this way: how inconsistent of them to have been always enemies of
<br>the body, and wanting to have the soul alone, and when this is granted
<br>to them, to be trembling and repining; instead of rejoicing at their
<br>departing to that place where, when they arrive, they hope to gain
<br>that which in life they loved (and this was wisdom), and at the same
<br>time to be rid of the company of their enemy. Many a man has been
<br>willing to go to the world below in the hope of seeing there an
<br>earthly love, or wife, or son, and conversing with them. And will he
<br>who is a true lover of wisdom, and is persuaded in like manner that
<br>only in the world below he can worthily enjoy her, still repine at
<br>death? Will he not depart with joy? Surely he will, my friend, if he
<br>be a true philosopher. For he will have a firm conviction that there
<br>only, and nowhere else, he can find wisdom in her purity. And if
<br>this be true, he would be very absurd, as I was saying, if he were
<br>to fear death.
<br>&nbsp; He would, indeed, replied Simmias.
<br>&nbsp; And when you see a man who is repining at the approach of death,
<br>is not his reluctance a sufficient proof that he is not a lover of
<br>wisdom, but a lover of the body, and probably at the same time a lover
<br>of either money or power, or both?
<br>&nbsp; That is very true, he replied.
<br>&nbsp; There is a virtue, Simmias, which is named courage. Is not that
a
<br>special attribute of the philosopher?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly.
<br>&nbsp; Again, there is temperance. Is not the calm, and control, and
<br>disdain of the passions which even the many call temperance, a quality
<br>belonging only to those who despise the body and live in philosophy?
<br>&nbsp; That is not to be denied.
<br>&nbsp; For the courage and temperance of other men, if you will consider
<br>them, are really a contradiction.
<br>&nbsp; How is that, Socrates?
<br>&nbsp; Well, he said, you are aware that death is regarded by men in
<br>general as a great evil.
<br>&nbsp; That is true, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And do not courageous men endure death because they are afraid
of
<br>yet greater evils?
<br>&nbsp; That is true.
<br>&nbsp; Then all but the philosophers are courageous only from fear,
and
<br>because they are afraid; and yet that a man should be courageous
<br>from fear, and because he is a coward, is surely a strange thing.
<br>&nbsp; Very true.
<br>&nbsp; And are not the temperate exactly in the same case? They are
<br>temperate because they are intemperate-which may seem to be a
<br>contradiction, but is nevertheless the sort of thing which happens
<br>with this foolish temperance. For there are pleasures which they
<br>must have, and are afraid of losing; and therefore they abstain from
<br>one class of pleasures because they are overcome by another: and
<br>whereas intemperance is defined as "being under the dominion of
<br>pleasure," they overcome only because they are overcome by pleasure.
<br>And that is what I mean by saying that they are temperate through
<br>intemperance.
<br>&nbsp; That appears to be true.
<br>&nbsp; Yet the exchange of one fear or pleasure or pain for another
fear or
<br>pleasure or pain, which are measured like coins, the greater with
<br>the less, is not the exchange of virtue. O my dear Simmias, is there
<br>not one true coin for which all things ought to exchange?-and that
<br>is wisdom; and only in exchange for this, and in company with this,
is
<br>anything truly bought or sold, whether courage or temperance or
<br>justice. And is not all true virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter
<br>what fears or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or may
not
<br>attend her? But the virtue which is made up of these goods, when
<br>they are severed from wisdom and exchanged with one another, is a
<br>shadow of virtue only, nor is there any freedom or health or truth
<br>in her; but in the true exchange there is a purging away of all
<br>these things, and temperance, and justice, and courage, and wisdom
<br>herself are a purgation of them. And I conceive that the founders of
<br>the mysteries had a real meaning and were not mere triflers when
<br>they intimated in a figure long ago that he who passes unsanctified
<br>and uninitiated into the world below will live in a slough, but that
<br>he who arrives there after initiation and purification will dwell with
<br>the gods. For "many," as they say in the mysteries, "are the thyrsus
<br>bearers, but few are the mystics,"-meaning, as I interpret the
<br>words, the true philosophers. In the number of whom I have been
<br>seeking, according to my ability, to find a place during my whole
<br>life; whether I have sought in a right way or not, and whether I
<br>have succeeded or not, I shall truly know in a little while, if God
<br>will, when I myself arrive in the other world: that is my belief.
<br>And now, Simmias and Cebes, I have answered those who charge me with
<br>not grieving or repining at parting from you and my masters in this
<br>world; and I am right in not repining, for I believe that I shall find
<br>other masters and friends who are as good in the world below. But
<br>all men cannot believe this, and I shall be glad if my words have
<br>any more success with you than with the judges of the Athenians.
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>(Cebes' objection)</b>
<br>&nbsp; Cebes answered: I agree, Socrates, in the greater part of what
you
<br>say. But in what relates to the soul, men are apt to be incredulous;
<br>they fear that when she leaves the body her place may be nowhere,
<br>and that on the very day of death she may be destroyed and
<br>perish-immediately on her release from the body, issuing forth like
<br>smoke or air and vanishing away into nothingness. For if she could
<br>only hold together and be herself after she was released from the
<br>evils of the body, there would be good reason to hope, Socrates,
<br>that what you say is true. But much persuasion and many arguments
<br>are required in order to prove that when the man is dead the soul
<br>yet exists, and has any force of intelligence.
<br>&nbsp; True, Cebes, said Socrates; and shall I suggest that we talk
a
<br>little of the probabilities of these things?
<br>&nbsp; I am sure, said Cebes, that I should gready like to know your
<br>opinion about them.
<p><b>(opposition)</b>
<br>&nbsp; I reckon, said Socrates, that no one who heard me now, not even
if
<br>he were one of my old enemies, the comic poets, could accuse me of
<br>idle talking about matters in which I have no concern. Let us, then,
<br>if you please, proceed with the inquiry.
<br>&nbsp; Whether the souls of men after death are or are not in the world
<br>below, is a question which may be argued in this manner: The ancient
<br>doctrine of which I have been speaking affirms that they go from
<br>this into the other world, and return hither, and are born from the
<br>dead. Now if this be true, and the living come from the dead, then
our
<br>souls must be in the other world, for if not, how could they be born
<br>again? And this would be conclusive, if there were any real evidence
<br>that the living are only born from the dead; but if there is no
<br>evidence of this, then other arguments will have to be adduced.
<br>&nbsp; That is very true, replied Cebes.
<br>&nbsp; Then let us consider this question, not in relation to man only,
but
<br>in relation to animals generally, and to plants, and to everything
<br>of which there is generation, and the proof will be easier. Are not
<br>all things which have opposites generated out of their opposites? I
<br>mean such things as good and evil, just and unjust-and there are
<br>innumerable other opposites which are generated out of opposites.
<br>And I want to show that this holds universally of all opposites; I
<br>mean to say, for example, that anything which becomes greater must
<br>become greater after being less.
<br>&nbsp; True.
<br>&nbsp; And that which becomes less must have been once greater and
then
<br>become less.
<br>&nbsp; Yes.
<br>&nbsp; And the weaker is generated from the stronger, and the swifter
<br>from the slower.
<br>&nbsp; Very true.
<br>&nbsp; And the worse is from the better, and the more just is from
the more
<br>unjust.
<br>&nbsp; Of course.
<br>&nbsp; And is this true of all opposites? and are we convinced that
all
<br>of them are generated out of opposites?
<br>&nbsp; Yes.
<br>&nbsp; And in this universal opposition of all things, are there not
also
<br>two intermediate processes which are ever going on, from one to the
<br>other, and back again; where there is a greater and a less there is
<br>also an intermediate process of increase and diminution, and that
<br>which grows is said to wax, and that which decays to wane?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And there are many other processes, such as division and
<br>composition, cooling and heating, which equally involve a passage into
<br>and out of one another. And this holds of all opposites, even though
<br>not always expressed in words-they are generated out of one another,
<br>and there is a passing or process from one to the other of them?
<br>&nbsp; Very true, he replied.
<br>&nbsp; Well, and is there not an opposite of life, as sleep is the
opposite
<br>of waking?
<br>&nbsp; True, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And what is that?
<br>&nbsp; Death, he answered.
<br>&nbsp; And these, then, are generated, if they are opposites, the one
<br>from the other, and have there their two intermediate processes also?
<br>&nbsp; Of course.
<br>&nbsp; Now, said Socrates, I will analyze one of the two pairs of opposites
<br>which I have mentioned to you, and also its intermediate processes,
<br>and you shall analyze the other to me. The state of sleep is opposed
<br>to the state of waking, and out of sleeping waking is generated, and
<br>out of waking, sleeping, and the process of generation is in the one
<br>case falling asleep, and in the other waking up. Are you agreed
<br>about that?
<br>&nbsp; Quite agreed.
<br>&nbsp; Then suppose that you analyze life and death to me in the same
<br>manner. Is not death opposed to life?
<br>&nbsp; Yes.
<br>&nbsp; And they are generated one from the other?
<br>&nbsp; Yes.
<br>&nbsp; What is generated from life?
<br>&nbsp; Death.
<br>&nbsp; And what from death?
<br>&nbsp; I can only say in answer-life.
<br>&nbsp; Then the living, whether things or persons, Cebes, are generated
<br>from the dead?
<br>&nbsp; That is clear, he replied.
<br>&nbsp; Then the inference is, that our souls are in the world below?
<br>&nbsp; That is true.
<br>&nbsp; And one of the two processes or generations is visible-for surely
<br>the act of dying is visible?
<br>&nbsp; Surely, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And may not the other be inferred as the complement of nature,
who
<br>is not to be supposed to go on one leg only? And if not, a
<br>corresponding process of generation in death must also be assigned
<br>to her?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly, he replied.
<br>&nbsp; And what is that process?
<br>&nbsp; Revival.
<br>&nbsp; And revival, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead
into
<br>the world of the living?
<br>&nbsp; Quite true.
<br>&nbsp; Then there is a new way in which we arrive at the inference
that the
<br>living come from the dead, just as the dead come from the living;
<br>and if this is true, then the souls of the dead must be in some
<br>place out of which they come again. And this, as I think, has been
<br>satisfactorily proved.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, Socrates, he said; all this seems to flow necessarily out
of
<br>our previous admissions.
<br>&nbsp; And that these admissions are not unfair, Cebes, he said, may
be
<br>shown, as I think, in this way: If generation were in a straight
<br>line only, and there were no compensation or circle in nature, no turn
<br>or return into one another, then you know that all things would at
<br>last have the same form and pass into the same state, and there
<br>would be no more generation of them.
<br>&nbsp; What do you mean? he said.
<br>&nbsp; A simple thing enough, which I will illustrate by the case of
sleep,
<br>he replied. You know that if there were no compensation of sleeping
<br>and waking, the story of the sleeping Endymion would in the end have
<br>no meaning, because all other things would be asleep, too, and he
<br>would not be thought of. Or if there were composition only, and no
<br>division of substances, then the chaos of Anaxagoras would come again.
<br>And in like manner, my dear Cebes, if all things which partook of life
<br>were to die, and after they were dead remained in the form of death,
<br>and did not come to life again, all would at last die, and nothing
<br>would be alive-how could this be otherwise? For if the living spring
<br>from any others who are not the dead, and they die, must not all
<br>things at last be swallowed up in death?
<br>&nbsp; There is no escape from that, Socrates, said Cebes; and I think
that
<br>what you say is entirely true.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, he said, Cebes, I entirely think so, too; and we are not
<br>walking in a vain imagination; but I am confident in the belief that
<br>there truly is such a thing as living again, and that the living
<br>spring from the dead, and that the souls of the dead are in existence,
<br>and that the good souls have a better portion than the evil.
<p><b>(recollection)</b>
<br>&nbsp; Cebes added: Your favorite doctrine, Socrates, that knowledge
is
<br>simply recollection, if true, also necessarily implies a previous time
<br>in which we learned that which we now recollect. But this would be
<br>impossible unless our soul was in some place before existing in the
<br>human form; here, then, is another argument of the soul's immortality.
<br>&nbsp; But tell me, Cebes, said Simmias, interposing, what proofs are
given
<br>of this doctrine of recollection? I am not very sure at this moment
<br>that I remember them.
<br>&nbsp; One excellent proof, said Cebes, is afforded by questions. If
you
<br>put a question to a person in a right way, he will give a true
<br>answer of himself; but how could he do this unless there were
<br>knowledge and right reason already in him? And this is most clearly
<br>shown when he is taken to a diagram or to anything of that sort.
<br>&nbsp; But if, said Socrates, you are still incredulous, Simmias, I
would
<br>ask you whether you may not agree with me when you look at the
<br>matter in another way; I mean, if you are still incredulous as to
<br>whether knowledge is recollection.
<br>&nbsp; Incredulous, I am not, said Simmias; but I want to have this
<br>doctrine of recollection brought to my own recollection, and, from
<br>what Cebes has said, I am beginning to recollect and be convinced;
but
<br>I should still like to hear what more you have to say.
<br>&nbsp; This is what I would say, he replied: We should agree, if I
am not
<br>mistaken, that what a man recollects he must have known at some
<br>previous time.
<br>&nbsp; Very true.
<br>&nbsp; And what is the nature of this recollection? And, in asking
this,
<br>I mean to ask whether, when a person has already seen or heard or in
<br>any way perceived anything, and he knows not only that, but
<br>something else of which he has not the same, but another knowledge,
we
<br>may not fairly say that he recollects that which comes into his
<br>mind. Are we agreed about that?
<br>&nbsp; What do you mean?
<br>&nbsp; I mean what I may illustrate by the following instance: The
<br>knowledge of a lyre is not the same as the knowledge of a man?
<br>&nbsp; True.
<br>&nbsp; And yet what is the feeling of lovers when they recognize a
lyre, or
<br>a garment, or anything else which the beloved has been in the habit
of
<br>using? Do not they, from knowing the lyre, form in the mind's eye an
<br>image of the youth to whom the lyre belongs? And this is recollection:
<br>and in the same way anyone who sees Simmias may remember Cebes; and
<br>there are endless other things of the same nature.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, indeed, there are-endless, replied Simmias.
<br>&nbsp; And this sort of thing, he said, is recollection, and is most
<br>commonly a process of recovering that which has been forgotten through
<br>time and inattention.
<br>&nbsp; Very true, he said.
<br>&nbsp; Well; and may you not also from seeing the picture of a horse
or a
<br>lyre remember a man? and from the picture of Simmias, you may be led
<br>to remember Cebes?
<br>&nbsp; True.
<br>&nbsp; Or you may also be led to the recollection of Simmias himself?
<br>&nbsp; True, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And in all these cases, the recollection may be derived from
<br>things either like or unlike?
<br>&nbsp; That is true.
<br>&nbsp; And when the recollection is derived from like things, then
there is
<br>sure to be another question, which is, whether the likeness of that
<br>which is recollected is in any way defective or not.
<br>&nbsp; Very true, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And shall we proceed a step further, and affirm that there is
such a
<br>thing as equality, not of wood with wood, or of stone with stone,
<br>but that, over and above this, there is equality in the abstract?
<br>Shall we affirm this?
<br>&nbsp; Affirm, yes, and swear to it, replied Simmias, with all the
<br>confidence in life.
<br>&nbsp; And do we know the nature of this abstract essence?
<br>&nbsp; To be sure, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And whence did we obtain this knowledge? Did we not see equalities
<br>of material things, such as pieces of wood and stones, and gather from
<br>them the idea of an equality which is different from them?-you will
<br>admit that? Or look at the matter again in this way: Do not the same
<br>pieces of wood or stone appear at one time equal, and at another
<br>time unequal?
<br>&nbsp; That is certain.
<br>&nbsp; But are real equals ever unequal? or is the idea of equality
ever
<br>inequality?
<br>&nbsp; That surely was never yet known, Socrates.
<br>&nbsp; Then these (so-called) equals are not the same with the idea
of
<br>equality?
<br>&nbsp; I should say, clearly not, Socrates.
<br>&nbsp; And yet from these equals, although differing from the idea
of
<br>equality, you conceived and attained that idea?
<br>&nbsp; Very true, he said.
<br>&nbsp; Which might be like, or might be unlike them?
<br>&nbsp; Yes.
<br>&nbsp; But that makes no difference; whenever from seeing one thing
you
<br>conceived another, whether like or unlike, there must surely have been
<br>an act of recollection?
<br>&nbsp; Very true.
<br>&nbsp; But what would you say of equal portions of wood and stone,
or other
<br>material equals? and what is the impression produced by them? Are they
<br>equals in the same sense as absolute equality? or do they fall short
<br>of this in a measure?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, he said, in a very great measure, too.
<br>&nbsp; And must we not allow that when I or anyone look at any object,
<br>and perceive that the object aims at being some other thing, but falls
<br>short of, and cannot attain to it-he who makes this observation must
<br>have had previous knowledge of that to which, as he says, the other,
<br>although similar, was inferior?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly.
<br>&nbsp; And has not this been our case in the matter of equals and of
<br>absolute equality?
<br>&nbsp; Precisely.
<br>&nbsp; Then we must have known absolute equality previously to the
time
<br>when we first saw the material equals, and reflected that all these
<br>apparent equals aim at this absolute equality, but fall short of it?
<br>&nbsp; That is true.
<br>&nbsp; And we recognize also that this absolute equality has only been
<br>known, and can only be known, through the medium of sight or touch,
or
<br>of some other sense. And this I would affirm of all such conceptions.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, Socrates, as far as the argument is concerned, one of them
is
<br>the same as the other.
<br>&nbsp; And from the senses, then, is derived the knowledge that all
<br>sensible things aim at an idea of equality of which they fall short-is
<br>not that true?
<br>&nbsp; Yes.
<br>&nbsp; Then before we began to see or hear or perceive in any way,
we
<br>must have had a knowledge of absolute equality, or we could not have
<br>referred to that the equals which are derived from the senses-for to
<br>that they all aspire, and of that they fall short?
<br>&nbsp; That, Socrates, is certainly to be inferred from the previous
<br>statements.
<br>&nbsp; And did we not see and hear and acquire our other senses as
soon
<br>as we were born?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly.
<br>&nbsp; Then we must have acquired the knowledge of the ideal equal
at
<br>some time previous to this?
<br>&nbsp; Yes.
<br>&nbsp; That is to say, before we were born, I suppose?
<br>&nbsp; True.
<br>&nbsp; And if we acquired this knowledge before we were born, and were
born
<br>having it, then we also knew before we were born and at the instant
of
<br>birth not only equal or the greater or the less, but all other
<br>ideas; for we are not speaking only of equality absolute, but of
<br>beauty, goodness, justice, holiness, and all which we stamp with the
<br>name of essence in the dialectical process, when we ask and answer
<br>questions. Of all this we may certainly affirm that we acquired the
<br>knowledge before birth?
<br>&nbsp; That is true.
<br>&nbsp; But if, after having acquired, we have not forgotten that which
we
<br>acquired, then we must always have been born with knowledge, and shall
<br>always continue to know as long as life lasts-for knowing is the
<br>acquiring and retaining knowledge and not forgetting. Is not
<br>forgetting, Simmias, just the losing of knowledge?
<br>&nbsp; Quite true, Socrates.
<br>&nbsp; But if the knowledge which we acquired before birth was lost
by us
<br>at birth, and afterwards by the use of the senses we recovered that
<br>which we previously knew, will not that which we call learning be a
<br>process of recovering our knowledge, and may not this be rightly
<br>termed recollection by us?
<br>&nbsp; Very true.
<br>&nbsp; For this is clear, that when we perceived something, either
by the
<br>help of sight or hearing, or some other sense, there was no difficulty
<br>in receiving from this a conception of some other thing like or unlike
<br>which had been forgotten and which was associated with this; and
<br>therefore, as I was saying, one of two alternatives follows: either
we
<br>had this knowledge at birth, and continued to know through life; or,
<br>after birth, those who are said to learn only remember, and learning
<br>is recollection only.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, that is quite true, Socrates.
<br>&nbsp; And which alternative, Simmias, do you prefer? Had we the
<br>knowledge at our birth, or did we remember afterwards the things which
<br>we knew previously to our birth?
<br>&nbsp; I cannot decide at the moment.
<br>&nbsp; At any rate you can decide whether he who has knowledge ought
or
<br>ought not to be able to give a reason for what he knows.
<br>&nbsp; Certainly, he ought.
<br>&nbsp; But do you think that every man is able to give a reason about
these
<br>very matters of which we are speaking?
<br>&nbsp; I wish that they could, Socrates, but I greatly fear that
<br>to-morrow at this time there will be no one able to give a reason
<br>worth having.
<br>&nbsp; Then you are not of opinion, Simmias, that all men know these
<br>things?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly not.
<br>&nbsp; Then they are in process of recollecting that which they learned
<br>before.
<br>&nbsp; Certainly.
<br>&nbsp; But when did our souls acquire this knowledge?-not since we
were
<br>born as men?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly not.
<br>&nbsp; And therefore previously?
<br>&nbsp; Yes.
<br>&nbsp; Then, Simmias, our souls must have existed before they were
in the
<br>form of man-without bodies, and must have had intelligence.
<br>&nbsp; Unless indeed you suppose, Socrates, that these notions were
given
<br>us at the moment of birth; for this is the only time that remains.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, my friend, but when did we lose them? for they are not
in us
<br>when we are born-that is admitted. Did we lose them at the moment of
<br>receiving them, or at some other time?
<br>&nbsp; No, Socrates, I perceive that I was unconsciously talking nonsense.
<br>&nbsp; Then may we not say, Simmias, that if, as we are always repeating,
<br>there is an absolute beauty, and goodness, and essence in general,
and
<br>to this, which is now discovered to be a previous condition of our
<br>being, we refer all our sensations, and with this compare
<br>them-assuming this to have a prior existence, then our souls must have
<br>had a prior existence, but if not, there would be no force in the
<br>argument? There can be no doubt that if these absolute ideas existed
<br>before we were born, then our souls must have existed before we were
<br>born, and if not the ideas, then not the souls.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, Socrates; I am convinced that there is precisely the same
<br>necessity for the existence of the soul before birth, and of the
<br>essence of which you are speaking: and the argument arrives at a
<br>result which happily agrees with my own notion. For there is nothing
<br>which to my mind is so evident as that beauty, goodness, and other
<br>notions of which you were just now speaking have a most real and
<br>absolute existence; and I am satisfied with the proof.
<br>&nbsp; Well, but is Cebes equally satisfied? for I must convince him
too.
<br>&nbsp; I think, said Simmias, that Cebes is satisfied: although he
is the
<br>most incredulous of mortals, yet I believe that he is convinced of
the
<br>existence of the soul before birth. But that after death the soul will
<br>continue to exist is not yet proven even to my own satisfaction. I
<br>cannot get rid of the feeling of the many to which Cebes was
<br>referring-the feeling that when the man dies the soul may be
<br>scattered, and that this may be the end of her. For admitting that
she
<br>may be generated and created in some other place, and may have existed
<br>before entering the human body, why after having entered in and gone
<br>out again may she not herself be destroyed and come to an end?
<br>&nbsp; Very true, Simmias, said Cebes; that our soul existed before
we were
<br>born was the first half of the argument, and this appears to have been
<br>proven; that the soul will exist after death as well as before birth
<br>is the other half of which the proof is still wanting, and has to be
<br>supplied.
<br>&nbsp; But that proof, Simmias and Cebes, has been already given, said
<br>Socrates, if you put the two arguments together-I mean this and the
<br>former one, in which we admitted that everything living is born of
the
<br>dead. For if the soul existed before birth, and in coming to life
<br>and being born can be born only from death and dying, must she not
<br>after death continue to exist, since she has to be born again?
<br>surely the proof which you desire has been already furnished. Still
<br>I suspect that you and Simmias would be glad to probe the argument
<br>further; like children, you are haunted with a fear that when the soul
<br>leaves the body, the wind may really blow her away and scatter her;
<br>especially if a man should happen to die in stormy weather and not
<br>when the sky is calm.
<br>&nbsp; Cebes answered with a smile: Then, Socrates, you must argue
us out
<br>of our fears-and yet, strictly speaking, they are not our fears, but
<br>there is a child within us to whom death is a sort of hobgoblin; him
<br>too we must persuade not to be afraid when he is alone with him in
the
<br>dark.
<br>&nbsp; Socrates said: Let the voice of the charmer be applied daily
until
<br>you have charmed him away.
<br>&nbsp; And where shall we find a good charmer of our fears, Socrates,
<br>when you are gone?
<br>&nbsp; Hellas, he replied, is a large place, Cebes, and has many good
<br>men, and there are barbarous races not a few: seek for him among
<br>them all, far and wide, sparing neither pains nor money; for there
<br>is no better way of using your money. And you must not forget to
<br>seek for him among yourselves too; for he is nowhere more likely to
be
<br>found.
<br>&nbsp; The search, replied Cebes, shall certainly be made. And now,
if
<br>you please, let us return to the point of the argument at which we
<br>digressed.
<br>&nbsp; By all means, replied Socrates; what else should I please?
<br>&nbsp; Very good, he said.
<p><b>(composition argument)</b>
<br>&nbsp; Must we not, said Socrates, ask ourselves some question of this
<br>sort?-What is that which, as we imagine, is liable to be scattered
<br>away, and about which we fear? and what again is that about which we
<br>have no fear? And then we may proceed to inquire whether that which
<br>suffers dispersion is or is not of the nature of soul-our hopes and
<br>fears as to our own souls will turn upon that.
<br>&nbsp; That is true, he said.
<br>&nbsp; Now the compound or composite may be supposed to be naturally
<br>capable of being dissolved in like manner as of being compounded;
<br>but that which is uncompounded, and that only, must be, if anything
<br>is, indissoluble.
<br>&nbsp; Yes; that is what I should imagine, said Cebes.
<br>&nbsp; And the uncompounded may be assumed to be the same and unchanging,
<br>where the compound is always changing and never the same?
<br>&nbsp; That I also think, he said.
<br>&nbsp; Then now let us return to the previous discussion. Is that idea
or
<br>essence, which in the dialectical process we define as essence of true
<br>existence-whether essence of equality, beauty, or anything else: are
<br>these essences, I say, liable at times to some degree of change? or
<br>are they each of them always what they are, having the same simple,
<br>self-existent and unchanging forms, and not admitting of variation
<br>at all, or in any way, or at any time?
<br>&nbsp; They must be always the same, Socrates, replied Cebes.
<br>&nbsp; And what would you say of the many beautiful-whether men or
horses
<br>or garments or any other things which may be called equal or
<br>beautiful-are they all unchanging and the same always, or quite the
<br>reverse? May they not rather be described as almost always changing
<br>and hardly ever the same either with themselves or with one another?
<br>&nbsp; The latter, replied Cebes; they are always in a state of change.
<br>&nbsp; And these you can touch and see and perceive with the senses,
but
<br>the unchanging things you can only perceive with the mind-they are
<br>invisible and are not seen?
<br>&nbsp; That is very true, he said.
<br>&nbsp; Well, then, he added, let us suppose that there are two sorts
of
<br>existences, one seen, the other unseen.
<br>&nbsp; Let us suppose them.
<br>&nbsp; The seen is the changing, and the unseen is the unchanging.
<br>&nbsp; That may be also supposed.
<br>&nbsp; And, further, is not one part of us body, and the rest of us
soul?
<br>&nbsp; To be sure.
<br>&nbsp; And to which class may we say that the body is more alike and
akin?
<br>&nbsp; Clearly to the seen: no one can doubt that.
<br>&nbsp; And is the soul seen or not seen?
<br>&nbsp; Not by man, Socrates.
<br>&nbsp; And by "seen" and "not seen" is meant by us that which is or
is
<br>not visible to the eye of man?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, to the eye of man.
<br>&nbsp; And what do we say of the soul? is that seen or not seen?
<br>&nbsp; Not seen.
<br>&nbsp; Unseen then?
<br>&nbsp; Yes.
<br>&nbsp; Then the soul is more like to the unseen, and the body to the
seen?
<br>&nbsp; That is most certain, Socrates.
<br>&nbsp; And were we not saying long ago that the soul when using the
body as
<br>an instrument of perception, that is to say, when using the sense of
<br>sight or hearing or some other sense (for the meaning of perceiving
<br>through the body is perceiving through the senses)-were we not
<br>saying that the soul too is then dragged by the body into the region
<br>of the changeable, and wanders and is confused; the world spins
<br>round her, and she is like a drunkard when under their influence?
<br>&nbsp; Very true.
<br>&nbsp; But when returning into herself she reflects; then she passes
into
<br>the realm of purity, and eternity, and immortality, and
<br>unchangeableness, which are her kindred, and with them she ever lives,
<br>when she is by herself and is not let or hindered; then she ceases
<br>from her erring ways, and being in communion with the unchanging is
<br>unchanging. And this state of the soul is called wisdom?
<br>&nbsp; That is well and truly said, Socrates, he replied.
<br>&nbsp; And to which class is the soul more nearly alike and akin, as
far as
<br>may be inferred from this argument, as well as from the preceding one?
<br>&nbsp; I think, Socrates, that, in the opinion of everyone who follows
<br>the argument, the soul will be infinitely more like the unchangeable
<br>even the most stupid person will not deny that.
<br>&nbsp; And the body is more like the changing?
<br>&nbsp; Yes.
<br>&nbsp; Yet once more consider the matter in this light: When the soul
and
<br>the body are united, then nature orders the soul to rule and govern,
<br>and the body to obey and serve.
<br>&nbsp; Now which of these two functions is akin to the divine? and
which to
<br>the mortal? Does not the divine appear to you to be that which
<br>naturally orders and rules, and the mortal that which is subject and
<br>servant?
<br>&nbsp; True.
<br>&nbsp; And which does the soul resemble?
<br>&nbsp; The soul resembles the divine and the body the mortal-there
can be
<br>no doubt of that, Socrates.
<br>&nbsp; Then reflect, Cebes: is not the conclusion of the whole matter
<br>this?-that the soul is in the very likeness of the divine, and
<br>immortal, and intelligible, and uniform, and indissoluble, and
<br>unchangeable; and the body is in the very likeness of the human, and
<br>mortal, and unintelligible, and multiform, and dissoluble, and
<br>changeable. Can this, my dear Cebes, be denied?
<br>&nbsp; No, indeed.
<br>&nbsp; But if this is true, then is not the body liable to speedy
<br>dissolution?
<br>&nbsp; and is not the soul almost or altogether indissoluble?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly.
<br>&nbsp; And do you further observe, that after a man is dead, the body,
<br>which is the visible part of man, and has a visible framework, which
<br>is called a corpse, and which would naturally be dissolved and
<br>decomposed and dissipated, is not dissolved or decomposed at once,
but
<br>may remain for a good while, if the constitution be sound at the
<br>time of death, and the season of the year favorable? For the body when
<br>shrunk and embalmed, as is the custom in Egypt, may remain almost
<br>entire through infinite ages; and even in decay, still there are
<br>some portions, such as the bones and ligaments, which are
<br>practically indestructible. You allow that?
<br>&nbsp; Yes.
<br>&nbsp; And are we to suppose that the soul, which is invisible, in
<br>passing to the true Hades, which like her is invisible, and pure,
<br>and noble, and on her way to the good and wise God, whither, if God
<br>will, my soul is also soon to go-that the soul, I repeat, if this be
<br>her nature and origin, is blown away and perishes immediately on
<br>quitting the body as the many say? That can never be, dear Simmias
and
<br>Cebes. The truth rather is that the soul which is pure at departing
<br>draws after her no bodily taint, having never voluntarily had
<br>connection with the body, which she is ever avoiding, herself gathered
<br>into herself (for such abstraction has been the study of her life).
<br>And what does this mean but that she has been a true disciple of
<br>philosophy and has practised how to die easily? And is not
<br>philosophy the practice of death?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly.
<br>&nbsp; That soul, I say, herself invisible, departs to the invisible
<br>worldto the divine and immortal and rational: thither arriving, she
<br>lives in bliss and is released from the error and folly of men,
<br>their fears and wild passions and all other human ills, and forever
<br>dwells, as they say of the initiated, in company with the gods. Is
not
<br>this true, Cebes?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, said Cebes, beyond a doubt.
<br>&nbsp; But the soul which has been polluted, and is impure at the time
of
<br>her departure, and is the companion and servant of the body always,
<br>and is in love with and fascinated by the body and by the desires
<br>and pleasures of the body, until she is led to believe that the
<br>truth only exists in a bodily form, which a man may touch and see
<br>and taste and use for the purposes of his lusts-the soul, I mean,
<br>accustomed to hate and fear and avoid the intellectual principle,
<br>which to the bodily eye is dark and invisible, and can be attained
<br>only by philosophy-do you suppose that such a soul as this will depart
<br>pure and unalloyed?
<br>&nbsp; That is impossible, he replied.
<br>&nbsp; She is engrossed by the corporeal, which the continual association
<br>and constant care of the body have made natural to her.
<br>&nbsp; Very true.
<br>&nbsp; And this, my friend, may be conceived to be that heavy, weighty,
<br>earthy element of sight by which such a soul is depressed and
<br>dragged down again into the visible world, because she is afraid of
<br>the invisible and of the world below-prowling about tombs and
<br>sepulchres, in the neighborhood of which, as they tell us, are seen
<br>certain ghostly apparitions of souls which have not departed pure,
but
<br>are cloyed with sight and therefore visible.
<br>&nbsp; That is very likely, Socrates.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, that is very likely, Cebes; and these must be the souls,
not of
<br>the good, but of the evil, who are compelled to wander about such
<br>places in payment of the penalty of their former evil way of life;
and
<br>they continue to wander until the desire which haunts them is
<br>satisfied and they are imprisoned in another body. And they may be
<br>supposed to be fixed in the same natures which they had in their
<br>former life.
<br>&nbsp; What natures do you mean, Socrates?
<br>&nbsp; I mean to say that men who have followed after gluttony, and
<br>wantonness, and drunkenness, and have had no thought of avoiding them,
<br>would pass into asses and animals of that sort. What do you think?
<br>&nbsp; I think that exceedingly probable.
<br>&nbsp; And those who have chosen the portion of injustice, and tyranny,
and
<br>violence, will pass into wolves, or into hawks and kites; whither else
<br>can we suppose them to go?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, said Cebes; that is doubtless the place of natures such
as
<br>theirs. And there is no difficulty, he said, in assigning to all of
<br>them places answering to their several natures and propensities?
<br>&nbsp; There is not, he said.
<br>&nbsp; Even among them some are happier than others; and the happiest
<br>both in themselves and their place of abode are those who have
<br>practised the civil and social virtues which are called temperance
and
<br>justice, and are acquired by habit and attention without philosophy
<br>and mind.
<br>&nbsp; Why are they the happiest?
<br>&nbsp; Because they may be expected to pass into some gentle, social
nature
<br>which is like their own, such as that of bees or ants, or even back
<br>again into the form of man, and just and moderate men spring from
<br>them.
<br>&nbsp; That is not impossible.
<br>&nbsp; But he who is a philosopher or lover of learning, and is entirely
<br>pure at departing, is alone permitted to reach the gods. And this is
<br>the reason, Simmias and Cebes, why the true votaries of philosophy
<br>abstain from all fleshly lusts, and endure and refuse to give
<br>themselves up to them-not because they fear poverty or the ruin of
<br>their families, like the lovers of money, and the world in general;
<br>nor like the lovers of power and honor, because they dread the
<br>dishonor or disgrace of evil deeds.
<br>&nbsp; No, Socrates, that would not become them, said Cebes.
<br>&nbsp; No, indeed, he replied; and therefore they who have a care of
<br>their souls, and do not merely live in the fashions of the body, say
<br>farewell to all this; they will not walk in the ways of the blind:
and
<br>when philosophy offers them purification and release from evil, they
<br>feel that they ought not to resist her influence, and to her they
<br>incline, and whither she leads they follow her.
<br>&nbsp; What do you mean, Socrates?
<br>&nbsp; I will tell you, he said. The lovers of knowledge are conscious
that
<br>their souls, when philosophy receives them, are simply fastened and
<br>glued to their bodies: the soul is only able to view existence through
<br>the bars of a prison, and not in her own nature; she is wallowing in
<br>the mire of all ignorance; and philosophy, seeing the terrible
<br>nature of her confinement, and that the captive through desire is
<br>led to conspire in her own captivity (for the lovers of knowledge
<br>are aware that this was the original state of the soul, and that
<br>when she was in this state philosophy received and gently counseled
<br>her, and wanted to release her, pointing out to her that the eye is
<br>full of deceit, and also the ear and other senses, and persuading
<br>her to retire from them in all but the necessary use of them and to
be
<br>gathered up and collected into herself, and to trust only to herself
<br>and her own intuitions of absolute existence, and mistrust that
<br>which comes to her through others and is subject to
<br>vicissitude)-philosophy shows her that this is visible and tangible,
<br>but that what she sees in her own nature is intellectual and
<br>invisible. And the soul of the true philosopher thinks that she
<br>ought not to resist this deliverance, and therefore abstains from
<br>pleasures and desires and pains and fears, as far as she is able;
<br>reflecting that when a man has great joys or sorrows or fears or
<br>desires he suffers from them, not the sort of evil which might be
<br>anticipated-as, for example, the loss of his health or property, which
<br>he has sacrificed to his lusts-but he has suffered an evil greater
<br>far, which is the greatest and worst of all evils, and one of which
he
<br>never thinks.
<br>&nbsp; And what is that, Socrates? said Cebes.
<br>&nbsp; Why, this: When the feeling of pleasure or pain in the soul
is
<br>most intense, all of us naturally suppose that the object of this
<br>intense feeling is then plainest and truest: but this is not the case.
<br>&nbsp; Very true.
<br>&nbsp; And this is the state in which the soul is most enthralled by
the
<br>body.
<br>&nbsp; How is that?
<br>&nbsp; Why, because each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which
nails
<br>and rivets the soul to the body, and engrosses her and makes her
<br>believe that to be true which the body affirms to be true; and from
<br>agreeing with the body and having the same delights she is obliged
<br>to have the same habits and ways, and is not likely ever to be pure
at
<br>her departure to the world below, but is always saturated with the
<br>body; so that she soon sinks into another body and there germinates
<br>and grows, and has therefore no part in the communion of the divine
<br>and pure and simple.
<br>&nbsp; That is most true, Socrates, answered Cebes.
<br>&nbsp; And this, Cebes, is the reason why the true lovers of knowledge
<br>are temperate and brave; and not for the reason which the world gives.
<br>&nbsp; Certainly not.
<br>&nbsp; Certainly not! For not in that way does the soul of a philosopher
<br>reason; she will not ask philosophy to release her in order that
<br>when released she may deliver herself up again to the thraldom of
<br>pleasures and pains, doing a work only to be undone again, weaving
<br>instead of unweaving her Penelope's web. But she will make herself
a
<br>calm of passion and follow Reason, and dwell in her, beholding the
<br>true and divine (which is not matter of opinion), and thence derive
<br>nourishment. Thus she seeks to live while she lives, and after death
<br>she hopes to go to her own kindred and to be freed from human ills.
<br>Never fear, Simmias and Cebes, that a soul which has been thus
<br>nurtured and has had these pursuits, will at her departure from the
<br>body be scattered and blown away by the winds and be nowhere and
<br>nothing.
<br>&nbsp; When Socrates had done speaking, for a considerable time there
was
<br>silence; he himself and most of us appeared to be meditating on what
<br>had been said; only Cebes and Simmias spoke a few words to one
<br>another. And Socrates observing this asked them what they thought of
<br>the argument, and whether there was anything wanting? For, said he,
<br>much is still open to suspicion and attack, if anyone were disposed
to
<br>sift the matter thoroughly. If you are talking of something else I
<br>would rather not interrupt you, but if you are still doubtful about
<br>the argument do not hesitate to say exactly what you think, and let
us
<br>have anything better which you can suggest; and if I am likely to be
<br>of any use, allow me to help you.
<br>&nbsp; Simmias said: I must confess, Socrates, that doubts did arise
in our
<br>minds, and each of us was urging and inciting the other to put the
<br>question which he wanted to have answered and which neither of us
<br>liked to ask, fearing that our importunity might be troublesome
<br>under present circumstances.
<br>&nbsp; Socrates smiled and said: O Simmias, how strange that is; I
am not
<br>very likely to persuade other men that I do not regard my present
<br>situation as a misfortune, if I am unable to persuade you, and you
<br>will keep fancying that I am at all more troubled now than at any
<br>other time. Will you not allow that I have as much of the spirit of
<br>prophecy in me as the swans? For they, when they perceive that they
<br>must die, having sung all their life long, do then sing more than
<br>ever, rejoicing in the thought that they are about to go away to the
<br>god whose ministers they are. But men, because they are themselves
<br>afraid of death, slanderously affirm of the swans that they sing a
<br>lament at the last, not considering that no bird sings when cold, or
<br>hungry, or in pain, not even the nightingale, nor the swallow, nor
yet
<br>the hoopoe; which are said indeed to tune a lay of sorrow, although
<br>I do not believe this to be true of them any more than of the swans.
<br>But because they are sacred to Apollo and have the gift of prophecy
<br>and anticipate the good things of another world, therefore they sing
<br>and rejoice in that day more than they ever did before. And I, too,
<br>believing myself to be the consecrated servant of the same God, and
<br>the fellow servant of the swans, and thinking that I have received
<br>from my master gifts of prophecy which are not inferior to theirs,
<br>would not go out of life less merrily than the swans. Cease to mind
<br>then about this, but speak and ask anything which you like, while
<br>the eleven magistrates of Athens allow.
<br>&nbsp; Well, Socrates, said Simmias, then I will tell you my difficulty,
<br>and Cebes will tell you his. For I dare say that you, Socrates,
<br>feel, as I do, how very hard or almost impossible is the attainment
of
<br>any certainty about questions such as these in the present life. And
<br>yet I should deem him a coward who did not prove what is said about
<br>them to the uttermost, or whose heart failed him before he had
<br>examined them on every side. For he should persevere until he has
<br>attained one of two things: either he should discover or learn the
<br>truth about them; or, if this is impossible, I would have him take
the
<br>best and most irrefragable of human notions, and let this be the
<br>raft upon which he sails through life-not without risk, as I admit,
if
<br>he cannot find some word of God which will more surely and safely
<br>carry him. And now, as you bid me, I will venture to question you,
<br>as I should not like to reproach myself hereafter with not having said
<br>at the time what I think. For when I consider the matter either
<br>alone or with Cebes, the argument does certainly appear to me,
<br>Socrates, to be not sufficient.
<br>&nbsp; Socrates answered: I dare say, my friend, that you may be right,
but
<br>I should like to know in what respect the argument is not sufficient.
<p><b>(harmony objection)</b>
<br>&nbsp; In this respect, replied Simmias: Might not a person use the
same
<br>argument about harmony and the lyre-might he not say that harmony is
a
<br>thing invisible, incorporeal, fair, divine, abiding in the lyre
<br>which is harmonized, but that the lyre and the strings are matter
<br>and material, composite, earthy, and akin to mortality? And when
<br>someone breaks the lyre, or cuts and rends the strings, then he who
<br>takes this view would argue as you do, and on the same analogy, that
<br>the harmony survives and has not perished; for you cannot imagine,
<br>as we would say, that the lyre without the strings, and the broken
<br>strings themselves, remain, and yet that the harmony, which is of
<br>heavenly and immortal nature and kindred, has perished-and perished
<br>too before the mortal. The harmony, he would say, certainly exists
<br>somewhere, and the wood and strings will decay before that decays.
For
<br>I suspect, Socrates, that the notion of the soul which we are all of
<br>us inclined to entertain, would also be yours, and that you too
<br>would conceive the body to be strung up, and held together, by the
<br>elements of hot and cold, wet and dry, and the like, and that the soul
<br>is the harmony or due proportionate admixture of them. And, if this
is
<br>true, the inference clearly is that when the strings of the body are
<br>unduly loosened or overstrained through disorder or other injury, then
<br>the soul, though most divine, like other harmonies of music or of
<br>the works of art, of course perishes at once, although the material
<br>remains of the body may last for a considerable time, until they are
<br>either decayed or burnt. Now if anyone maintained that the soul, being
<br>the harmony of the elements of the body, first perishes in that
<br>which is called death, how shall we answer him?
<br>&nbsp; Socrates looked round at us as his manner was, and said, with
a
<br>smile: Simmias has reason on his side; and why does not some one of
<br>you who is abler than myself answer him? for there is force in his
<br>attack upon me. But perhaps, before we answer him, we had better
<br>also hear what Cebes has to say against the argument-this will give
us
<br>time for reflection, and when both of them have spoken, we may
<br>either assent to them if their words appear to be in consonance with
<br>the truth, or if not, we may take up the other side, and argue with
<br>them. Please to tell me then, Cebes, he said, what was the
<br>difficulty which troubled you?
<p><b>(weaver objection)</b>
<br>&nbsp; Cebes said: I will tell you. My feeling is that the argument
is
<br>still in the same position, and open to the same objections which were
<br>urged before; for I am ready to admit that the existence of the soul
<br>before entering into the bodily form has been very ingeniously, and,
<br>as I may be allowed to say, quite sufficiently proven; but the
<br>existence of the soul after death is still, in my judgment,
<br>unproven. Now my objection is not the same as that of Simmias; for
I
<br>am not disposed to deny that the soul is stronger and more lasting
<br>than the body, being of opinion that in all such respects the soul
<br>very far excels the body. Well, then, says the argument to me, why
<br>do you remain unconvinced? When you see that the weaker is still in
<br>existence after the man is dead, will you not admit that the more
<br>lasting must also survive during the same period of time? Now I,
<br>like Simmias, must employ a figure; and I shall ask you to consider
<br>whether the figure is to the point. The parallel which I will
<br>suppose is that of an old weaver, who dies, and after his death
<br>somebody says: He is not dead, he must be alive; and he appeals to
the
<br>coat which he himself wove and wore, and which is still whole and
<br>undecayed. And then he proceeds to ask of someone who is
<br>incredulous, whether a man lasts longer, or the coat which is in use
<br>and wear; and when he is answered that a man lasts far longer,
<br>thinks that he has thus certainly demonstrated the survival of the
<br>man, who is the more lasting, because the less lasting remains. But
<br>that, Simmias, as I would beg you to observe, is not the truth;
<br>everyone sees that he who talks thus is talking nonsense. For the
<br>truth is that this weaver, having worn and woven many such coats,
<br>though he outlived several of them, was himself outlived by the
<br>last; but this is surely very far from proving that a man is
<br>slighter and weaker than a coat. Now the relation of the body to the
<br>soul may be expressed in a similar figure; for you may say with reason
<br>that the soul is lasting, and the body weak and short-lived in
<br>comparison. And every soul may be said to wear out many bodies,
<br>especially in the course of a long life. For if while the man is alive
<br>the body deliquesces and decays, and yet the soul always weaves her
<br>garment anew and repairs the waste, then of course, when the soul
<br>perishes, she must have on her last garment, and this only will
<br>survive her; but then again when the soul is dead the body will at
<br>last show its native weakness, and soon pass into decay. And therefore
<br>this is an argument on which I would rather not rely as proving that
<br>the soul exists after death. For suppose that we grant even more
<br>than you affirm as within the range of possibility, and besides
<br>acknowledging that the soul existed before birth admit also that after
<br>death the souls of some are existing still, and will exist, and will
<br>be born and die again and again, and that there is a natural
<br>strength in the soul which will hold out and be born many times-for
<br>all this, we may be still inclined to think that she will weary in
the
<br>labors of successive births, and may at last succumb in one of her
<br>deaths and utterly perish; and this death and dissolution of the
<br>body which brings destruction to the soul may be unknown to any of
us,
<br>for no one of us can have had any experience of it: and if this be
<br>true, then I say that he who is confident in death has but a foolish
<br>confidence, unless he is able to prove that the soul is altogether
<br>immortal and imperishable. But if he is not able to prove this, he
who
<br>is about to die will always have reason to fear that when the body
<br>is disunited, the soul also may utterly perish.
<br>&nbsp; All of us, as we afterwards remarked to one another, had an
<br>unpleasant feeling at hearing them say this. When we had been so
<br>firmly convinced before, now to have our faith shaken seemed to
<br>introduce a confusion and uncertainty, not only into the previous
<br>argument, but into any future one; either we were not good judges,
<br>or there were no real grounds of belief.
<br>&nbsp; Ech. There I feel with you-indeed I do, Phaedo, and when you
were
<br>speaking, I was beginning to ask myself the same question: What
<br>argument can I ever trust again? For what could be more convincing
<br>than the argument of Socrates, which has now fallen into discredit?
<br>That the soul is a harmony is a doctrine which has always had a
<br>wonderful attraction for me, and, when mentioned, came back to me at
<br>once, as my own original conviction. And now I must begin again and
<br>find another argument which will assure me that when the man is dead
<br>the soul dies not with him. Tell me, I beg, how did Socrates
<br>proceed? Did he appear to share the unpleasant feeling which you
<br>mention? or did he receive the interruption calmly and give a
<br>sufficient answer? Tell us, as exactly as you can, what passed.
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. Often, Echecrates, as I have admired Socrates, I never
<br>admired him more than at that moment. That he should be able to answer
<br>was nothing, but what astonished me was, first, the gentle and
<br>pleasant and approving manner in which he regarded the words of the
<br>young men, and then his quick sense of the wound which had been
<br>inflicted by the argument, and his ready application of the healing
<br>art. He might be compared to a general rallying his defeated and
<br>broken army, urging them to follow him and return to the field of
<br>argument.
<br>&nbsp; Ech. How was that?
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. You shall hear, for I was close to him on his right hand,
<br>seated on a sort of stool, and he on a couch which was a good deal
<br>higher. Now he had a way of playing with my hair, and then he smoothed
<br>my head, and pressed the hair upon my neck, and said: To-morrow,
<br>Phaedo, I suppose that these fair locks of yours will be severed.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, Socrates, I suppose that they will, I replied.
<br>&nbsp; Not so if you will take my advice.
<br>&nbsp; What shall I do with them? I said.
<br>&nbsp; To-day, he replied, and not to-morrow, if this argument dies
and
<br>cannot be brought to life again by us, you and I will both shave our
<br>locks; and if I were you, and could not maintain my ground against
<br>Simmias and Cebes, I would myself take an oath, like the Argives,
<br>not to wear hair any more until I had renewed the conflict and
<br>defeated them.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, I said, but Heracles himself is said not to be a match
for two.
<br>&nbsp; Summon me then, he said, and I will be your Iolaus until the
sun
<br>goes down.
<br>&nbsp; I summon you rather, I said, not as Heracles summoning Iolaus,
but
<br>as Iolaus might summon Heracles.
<br>&nbsp; That will be all the same, he said. But first let us take care
<br>that we avoid a danger.
<br>&nbsp; And what is that? I said.
<p><b>(misologism)</b>
<br>&nbsp; The danger of becoming misologists, he replied, which is one
of
<br>the very worst things that can happen to us. For as there are
<br>misanthropists or haters of men, there are also misologists or
<br>haters of ideas, and both spring from the same cause, which is
<br>ignorance of the world. Misanthropy arises from the too great
<br>confidence of inexperience; you trust a man and think him altogether
<br>true and good and faithful, and then in a little while he turns out
to
<br>be false and knavish; and then another and another, and when this
<br>has happened several times to a man, especially within the circle of
<br>his most trusted friends, as he deems them, and he has often quarreled
<br>with them, he at last hates all men, and believes that no one has
<br>any good in him at all. I dare say that you must have observed this.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, I said.
<br>&nbsp; And is not this discreditable? The reason is that a man, having
to
<br>deal with other men, has no knowledge of them; for if he had knowledge
<br>he would have known the true state of the case, that few are the
<br>good and few the evil, and that the great majority are in the interval
<br>between them.
<br>&nbsp; How do you mean? I said.
<br>&nbsp; I mean, he replied, as you might say of the very large and very
<br>small, that nothing is more uncommon than a very large or a very small
<br>man; and this applies generally to all extremes, whether of great
<br>and small, or swift and slow, or fair and foul, or black and white:
<br>and whether the instances you select be men or dogs or anything
<br>else, few are the extremes, but many are in the mean between them.
Did
<br>you never observe this?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, I said, I have.
<br>&nbsp; And do you not imagine, he said, that if there were a competition
of
<br>evil, the first in evil would be found to be very few?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, that is very likely, I said.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, that is very likely, he replied; not that in this respect
<br>arguments are like men-there I was led on by you to say more than I
<br>had intended; but the point of comparison was that when a simple man
<br>who has no skill in dialectics believes an argument to be true which
<br>he afterwards imagines to be false, whether really false or not, and
<br>then another and another, he has no longer any faith left, and great
<br>disputers, as you know, come to think, at last that they have grown
to
<br>be the wisest of mankind; for they alone perceive the utter
<br>unsoundness and instability of all arguments, or, indeed, of all
<br>things, which, like the currents in the Euripus, are going up and down
<br>in never-ceasing ebb and flow.
<br>&nbsp; That is quite true, I said.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, Phaedo, he replied, and very melancholy too, if there be
such a
<br>thing as truth or certainty or power of knowing at all, that a man
<br>should have lighted upon some argument or other which at first
<br>seemed true and then turned out to be false, and instead of blaming
<br>himself and his own want of wit, because he is annoyed, should at last
<br>be too glad to transfer the blame from himself to arguments in
<br>general; and forever afterwards should hate and revile them, and
<br>lose the truth and knowledge of existence.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, indeed, I said; that is very melancholy.
<br>&nbsp; Let us, then, in the first place, he said, be careful of admitting
<br>into our souls the notion that there is no truth or health or
<br>soundness in any arguments at all; but let us rather say that there
is
<br>as yet no health in us, and that we must quit ourselves like men and
<br>do our best to gain health-you and all other men with a view to the
<br>whole of your future life, and I myself with a view to death. For at
<br>this moment I am sensible that I have not the temper of a philosopher;
<br>like the vulgar, I am only a partisan. For the partisan, when he is
<br>engaged in a dispute, cares nothing about the rights of the
<br>question, but is anxious only to convince his hearers of his own
<br>assertions. And the difference between him and me at the present
<br>moment is only this-that whereas he seeks to convince his hearers that
<br>what he says is true, I am rather seeking to convince myself; to
<br>convince my hearers is a secondary matter with me. And do but see
<br>how much I gain by this. For if what I say is true, then I do well
<br>to be persuaded of the truth, but if there be nothing after death,
<br>still, during the short time that remains, I shall save my friends
<br>from lamentations, and my ignorance will not last, and therefore no
<br>harm will be done. This is the state of mind, Simmias and Cebes, in
<br>which I approach the argument. And I would ask you to be thinking of
<br>the truth and not of Socrates: agree with me, if I seem to you to be
<br>speaking the truth; or if not, withstand me might and main, that I
may
<br>not deceive you as well as myself in my enthusiasm, and, like the bee,
<br>leave my sting in you before I die.
<p><b>(Reply to Simmias)</b>
<br>&nbsp; And now let us proceed, he said. And first of all let me be
sure
<br>that I have in my mind what you were saying. Simmias, if I remember
<br>rightly, has fears and misgivings whether the soul, being in the
<br>form of harmony, although a fairer and diviner thing than the body,
<br>may not perish first. On the other hand, Cebes appeared to grant
<br>that the soul was more lasting than the body, but he said that no
<br>one could know whether the soul, after having worn out many bodies,
<br>might not perish herself and leave her last body behind her; and
<br>that this is death, which is the destruction not of the body but of
<br>the soul, for in the body the work of destruction is ever going on.
<br>Are not these, Simmias and Cebes, the points which we have to
<br>consider?
<br>&nbsp; They both agreed to this statement of them.
<br>&nbsp; He proceeded: And did you deny the force of the whole preceding
<br>argument, or of a part only?
<br>&nbsp; Of a part only, they replied.
<br>&nbsp; And what did you think, he said, of that part of the argument
in
<br>which we said that knowledge was recollection only, and inferred
<br>from this that the soul must have previously existed somewhere else
<br>before she was enclosed in the body? Cebes said that he had been
<br>wonderfully impressed by that part of the argument, and that his
<br>conviction remained unshaken. Simmias agreed, and added that he
<br>himself could hardly imagine the possibility of his ever thinking
<br>differently about that.
<br>&nbsp; But, rejoined Socrates, you will have to think differently,
my
<br>Theban friend, if you still maintain that harmony is a compound, and
<br>that the soul is a harmony which is made out of strings set in the
<br>frame of the body; for you will surely never allow yourself to say
<br>that a harmony is prior to the elements which compose the harmony.
<br>&nbsp; No, Socrates, that is impossible.
<br>&nbsp; But do you not see that you are saying this when you say that
the
<br>soul existed before she took the form and body of man, and was made
up
<br>of elements which as yet had no existence? For harmony is not a sort
<br>of thing like the soul, as you suppose; but first the lyre, and the
<br>strings, and the sounds exist in a state of discord, and then
<br>harmony is made last of all, and perishes first. And how can such a
<br>notion of the soul as this agree with the other?
<br>&nbsp; Not at all, replied Simmias.
<br>&nbsp; And yet, he said, there surely ought to be harmony when harmony
is
<br>the theme of discourse.
<br>&nbsp; There ought, replied Simmias.
<br>&nbsp; But there is no harmony, he said, in the two propositions that
<br>knowledge is recollection, and that the soul is a harmony. Which of
<br>them, then, will you retain?
<br>&nbsp; I think, he replied, that I have a much stronger faith, Socrates,
in
<br>the first of the two, which has been fully demonstrated to me, than
in
<br>the latter, which has not been demonstrated at all, but rests only
<br>on probable and plausible grounds; and I know too well that these
<br>arguments from probabilities are impostors, and unless great caution
<br>is observed in the use of them they are apt to be deceptive-in
<br>geometry, and in other things too. But the doctrine of knowledge and
<br>recollection has been proven to me on trustworthy grounds; and the
<br>proof was that the soul must have existed before she came into the
<br>body, because to her belongs the essence of which the very name
<br>implies existence. Having, as I am convinced, rightly accepted this
<br>conclusion, and on sufficient grounds, I must, as I suppose, cease
<br>to argue or allow others to argue that the soul is a harmony.
<br>&nbsp; Let me put the matter, Simmias, he said, in another point of
view:
<br>Do you imagine that a harmony or any other composition can be in a
<br>state other than that of the elements out of which it is compounded?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly not.
<br>&nbsp; Or do or suffer anything other than they do or suffer?
<br>&nbsp; He agreed.
<br>&nbsp; Then a harmony does not lead the parts or elements which make
up the
<br>harmony, but only follows them.
<br>&nbsp; He assented.
<br>&nbsp; For harmony cannot possibly have any motion, or sound, or other
<br>quality which is opposed to the parts.
<br>&nbsp; That would be impossible, he replied.
<br>&nbsp; And does not every harmony depend upon the manner in which the
<br>elements are harmonized?
<br>&nbsp; I do not understand you, he said.
<br>&nbsp; I mean to say that a harmony admits of degrees, and is more
of a
<br>harmony, and more completely a harmony, when more completely
<br>harmonized, if that be possible; and less of a harmony, and less
<br>completely a harmony, when less harmonized.
<br>&nbsp; True.
<br>&nbsp; But does the soul admit of degrees? or is one soul in the very
least
<br>degree more or less, or more or less completely, a soul than another?
<br>&nbsp; Not in the least.
<br>&nbsp; Yet surely one soul is said to have intelligence and virtue,
and
<br>to be good, and another soul is said to have folly and vice, and to
be
<br>an evil soul: and this is said truly?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, truly.
<br>&nbsp; But what will those who maintain the soul to be a harmony say
of
<br>this presence of virtue and vice in the soul?-Will they say that there
<br>is another harmony, and another discord, and that the virtuous soul
is
<br>harmonized, and herself being a harmony has another harmony within
<br>her, and that the vicious soul is inharmonical and has no harmony
<br>within her?
<br>&nbsp; I cannot say, replied Simmias; but I suppose that something
of
<br>that kind would be asserted by those who take this view.
<br>&nbsp; And the admission is already made that no soul is more a soul
than
<br>another; and this is equivalent to admitting that harmony is not
<br>more or less harmony, or more or less completely a harmony?
<br>&nbsp; Quite true.
<br>&nbsp; And that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or
less
<br>harmonized?
<br>&nbsp; True.
<br>&nbsp; And that which is not more or less harmonized cannot have more
or
<br>less of harmony, but only an equal harmony?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, an equal harmony.
<br>&nbsp; Then one soul not being more or less absolutely a soul than
another,
<br>is not more or less harmonized?
<br>&nbsp; Exactly.
<br>&nbsp; And therefore has neither more nor less of harmony or of discord?
<br>&nbsp; She has not.
<br>&nbsp; And having neither more nor less of harmony or of discord, one
<br>soul has no more vice or virtue than another, if vice be discord and
<br>virtue harmony?
<br>&nbsp; Not at all more.
<br>&nbsp; Or speaking more correctly, Simmias, the soul, if she is a
<br>harmony, will never have any vice; because a harmony, being absolutely
<br>a harmony, has no part in the inharmonical?
<br>&nbsp; No.
<br>&nbsp; And therefore a soul which is absolutely a soul has no vice?
<br>&nbsp; How can she have, consistently with the preceding argument?
<br>&nbsp; Then, according to this, if the souls of all animals are equally
and
<br>absolutely souls, they will be equally good?
<br>&nbsp; I agree with you, Socrates, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And can all this be true, think you? he said; and are all these
<br>consequences admissible-which nevertheless seem to follow from the
<br>assumption that the soul is a harmony?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly not, he said.
<br>&nbsp; Once more, he said, what ruling principle is there of human
things
<br>other than the soul, and especially the wise soul? Do you know of any?
<br>&nbsp; Indeed, I do not.
<br>&nbsp; And is the soul in agreement with the affections of the body?
or
<br>is she at variance with them? For example, when the body is hot and
<br>thirsty, does not the soul incline us against drinking? and when the
<br>body is hungry, against eating? And this is only one instance out of
<br>ten thousand of the opposition of the soul to the things of the body.
<br>&nbsp; Very true.
<br>&nbsp; But we have already acknowledged that the soul, being a harmony,
can
<br>never utter a note at variance with the tensions and relaxations and
<br>vibrations and other affections of the strings out of which she is
<br>composed; she can only follow, she cannot lead them?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, he said, we acknowledged that, certainly.
<br>&nbsp; And yet do we not now discover the soul to be doing the exact
<br>opposite-leading the elements of which she is believed to be composed;
<br>almost always opposing and coercing them in all sorts of ways
<br>throughout life, sometimes more violently with the pains of medicine
<br>and gymnastic; then again more gently; threatening and also
<br>reprimanding the desires, passions, fears, as if talking to a thing
<br>which is not herself, as Homer in the "Odyssey" represents Odysseus
<br>doing in the words,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He beat his breast, and thus reproached his
heart:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Endure, my heart; far worse hast thou endured!"
<p>Do you think that Homer could have written this under the idea that
<br>the soul is a harmony capable of being led by the affections of the
<br>body, and not rather of a nature which leads and masters them; and
<br>herself a far diviner thing than any harmony?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, Socrates, I quite agree to that.
<br>&nbsp; Then, my friend, we can never be right in saying that the soul
is
<br>a harmony, for that would clearly contradict the divine Homer as
<br>well as ourselves.
<br>&nbsp; True, he said.
<br>&nbsp; Thus much, said Socrates, of Harmonia, your Theban goddess,
Cebes,
<br>who has not been ungracious to us, I think; but what shall I say to
<br>the Theban Cadmus, and how shall I propitiate him?
<br>&nbsp; I think that you will discover a way of propitiating him, said
<br>Cebes; I am sure that you have answered the argument about harmony
<br>in a manner that I could never have expected. For when Simmias
<br>mentioned his objection, I quite imagined that no answer could be
<br>given to him, and therefore I was surprised at finding that his
<br>argument could not sustain the first onset of yours; and not
<br>impossibly the other, whom you call Cadmus, may share a similar fate.
<br>&nbsp; Nay, my good friend, said Socrates, let us not boast, lest some
evil
<br>eye should put to flight the word which I am about to speak. That,
<br>however, may be left in the hands of those above, while I draw near
in
<br>Homeric fashion, and try the mettle of your words. Briefly, the sum
of
<br>your objection is as follows: You want to have proven to you that
<br>the soul is imperishable and immortal, and you think that the
<br>philosopher who is confident in death has but a vain and foolish
<br>confidence, if he thinks that he will fare better than one who has
led
<br>another sort of life, in the world below, unless he can prove this;
<br>and you say that the demonstration of the strength and divinity of
the
<br>soul, and of her existence prior to our becoming men, does not
<br>necessarily imply her immortality. Granting that the soul is
<br>longlived, and has known and done much in a former state, still she
is
<br>not on that account immortal; and her entrance into the human form
may
<br>be a sort of disease which is the beginning of dissolution, and may
at
<br>last, after the toils of life are over, end in that which is called
<br>death. And whether the soul enters into the body once only or many
<br>times, that, as you would say, makes no difference in the fears of
<br>individuals. For any man, who is not devoid of natural feeling, has
<br>reason to fear, if he has no knowledge or proof of the soul's
<br>immortality. That is what I suppose you to say, Cebes, which I
<br>designedly repeat, in order that nothing may escape us, and that you
<br>may, if you wish, add or subtract anything.
<br>&nbsp; But, said Cebes, as far as I can see at present, I have nothing
to
<br>add or subtract; you have expressed my meaning.
<br>&nbsp; Socrates paused awhile, and seemed to be absorbed in reflection.
<br>At length he said: This is a very serious inquiry which you are
<br>raising, Cebes, involving the whole question of generation and
<br>corruption, about which I will, if you like, give you my own
<br>experience; and you can apply this, if you think that anything which
I
<br>say will avail towards the solution of your difficulty.
<br>&nbsp; I should very much like, said Cebes, to hear what you have to
say.
<p><b>(digression)</b>
<br>&nbsp; Then I will tell you, said Socrates. When I was young, Cebes,
I
<br>had a prodigious desire to know that department of philosophy which
is
<br>called Natural Science; this appeared to me to have lofty aims, as
<br>being the science which has to do with the causes of things, and which
<br>teaches why a thing is, and is created and destroyed; and I was always
<br>agitating myself with the consideration of such questions as these:
Is
<br>the growth of animals the result of some decay which the hot and
<br>cold principle contracts, as some have said? Is the blood the
<br>element with which we think, or the air, or the fire? or perhaps
<br>nothing of this sort-but the brain may be the originating power of
the
<br>perceptions of hearing and sight and smell, and memory and opinion
may
<br>come from them, and science may be based on memory and opinion when
no
<br>longer in motion, but at rest. And then I went on to examine the decay
<br>of them, and then to the things of heaven and earth, and at last I
<br>concluded that I was wholly incapable of these inquiries, as I will
<br>satisfactorily prove to you. For I was fascinated by them to such a
<br>degree that my eyes grew blind to things that I had seemed to
<br>myself, and also to others, to know quite well; and I forgot what I
<br>had before thought to be self-evident, that the growth of man is the
<br>result of eating and drinking; for when by the digestion of food flesh
<br>is added to flesh and bone to bone, and whenever there is an
<br>aggregation of congenial elements, the lesser bulk becomes larger
<br>and the small man greater. Was not that a reasonable notion?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, said Cebes, I think so.
<br>&nbsp; Well; but let me tell you something more. There was a time when
I
<br>thought that I understood the meaning of greater and less pretty well;
<br>and when I saw a great man standing by a little one I fancied that
one
<br>was taller than the other by a head; or one horse would appear to be
<br>greater than another horse: and still more clearly did I seem to
<br>perceive that ten is two more than eight, and that two cubits are more
<br>than one, because two is twice one.
<br>&nbsp; And what is now your notion of such matters? said Cebes.
<br>&nbsp; I should be far enough from imagining, he replied, that I knew
the
<br>cause of any of them, indeed I should, for I cannot satisfy myself
<br>that when one is added to one, the one to which the addition is made
<br>becomes two, or that the two units added together make two by reason
<br>of the addition. For I cannot understand how, when separated from
<br>the other, each of them was one and not two, and now, when they are
<br>brought together, the mere juxtaposition of them can be the cause of
<br>their becoming two: nor can I understand how the division of one is
<br>the way to make two; for then a different cause would produce the same
<br>effect-as in the former instance the addition and juxtaposition of
one
<br>to one was the cause of two, in this the separation and subtraction
of
<br>one from the other would be the cause. Nor am I any longer satisfied
<br>that I understand the reason why one or anything else either is
<br>generated or destroyed or is at all, but I have in my mind some
<br>confused notion of another method, and can never admit this.
<br>&nbsp; Then I heard someone who had a book of Anaxagoras, as he said,
out
<br>of which he read that mind was the disposer and cause of all, and I
<br>was quite delighted at the notion of this, which appeared admirable,
<br>and I said to myself: If mind is the disposer, mind will dispose all
<br>for the best, and put each particular in the best place; and I
<br>argued that if anyone desired to find out the cause of the
<br>generation or destruction or existence of anything, he must find out
<br>what state of being or suffering or doing was best for that thing,
and
<br>therefore a man had only to consider the best for himself and
<br>others, and then he would also know the worse, for that the same
<br>science comprised both. And I rejoiced to think that I had found in
<br>Anaxagoras a teacher of the causes of existence such as I desired,
and
<br>I imagined that he would tell me first whether the earth is flat or
<br>round; and then he would further explain the cause and the necessity
<br>of this, and would teach me the nature of the best and show that
<br>this was best; and if he said that the earth was in the centre, he
<br>would explain that this position was the best, and I should be
<br>satisfied if this were shown to me, and not want any other sort of
<br>cause. And I thought that I would then go and ask him about the sun
<br>and moon and stars, and that he would explain to me their
<br>comparative swiftness, and their returnings and various states, and
<br>how their several affections, active and passive, were all for the
<br>best. For I could not imagine that when he spoke of mind as the
<br>disposer of them, he would give any other account of their being as
<br>they are, except that this was best; and I thought when he had
<br>explained to me in detail the cause of each and the cause of all, he
<br>would go on to explain to me what was best for each and what was
<br>best for all. I had hopes which I would not have sold for much, and
<br>I seized the books and read them as fast as I could in my eagerness
to
<br>know the better and the worse.
<br>&nbsp; What hopes I had formed, and how grievously was I disappointed!
As I
<br>proceeded, I found my philosopher altogether forsaking mind or any
<br>other principle of order, but having recourse to air, and ether, and
<br>water, and other eccentricities. I might compare him to a person who
<br>began by maintaining generally that mind is the cause of the actions
<br>of Socrates, but who, when he endeavored to explain the causes of my
<br>several actions in detail, went on to show that I sit here because
<br>my body is made up of bones and muscles; and the bones, as he would
<br>say, are hard and have ligaments which divide them, and the muscles
<br>are elastic, and they cover the bones, which have also a covering or
<br>environment of flesh and skin which contains them; and as the bones
<br>are lifted at their joints by the contraction or relaxation of the
<br>muscles, I am able to bend my limbs, and this is why I am sitting here
<br>in a curved posture: that is what he would say, and he would have a
<br>similar explanation of my talking to you, which he would attribute
<br>to sound, and air, and hearing, and he would assign ten thousand other
<br>causes of the same sort, forgetting to mention the true cause, which
<br>is that the Athenians have thought fit to condemn me, and
<br>accordingly I have thought it better and more right to remain here
and
<br>undergo my sentence; for I am inclined to think that these muscles
and
<br>bones of mine would have gone off to Megara or Boeotia-by the dog of
<br>Egypt they would, if they had been guided only by their own idea of
<br>what was best, and if I had not chosen as the better and nobler
<br>part, instead of playing truant and running away, to undergo any
<br>punishment which the State inflicts. There is surely a strange
<br>confusion of causes and conditions in all this. It may be said,
<br>indeed, that without bones and muscles and the other parts of the body
<br>I cannot execute my purposes. But to say that I do as I do because
<br>of them, and that this is the way in which mind acts, and not from
the
<br>choice of the best, is a very careless and idle mode of speaking. I
<br>wonder that they cannot distinguish the cause from the condition,
<br>which the many, feeling about in the dark, are always mistaking and
<br>misnaming. And thus one man makes a vortex all round and steadies
<br>the earth by the heaven; another gives the air as a support to the
<br>earth, which is a sort of broad trough. Any power which in disposing
<br>them as they are disposes them for the best never enters into their
<br>minds, nor do they imagine that there is any superhuman strength in
<br>that; they rather expect to find another Atlas of the world who is
<br>stronger and more everlasting and more containing than the good is,
<br>and are clearly of opinion that the obligatory and containing power
of
<br>the good is as nothing; and yet this is the principle which I would
<br>fain learn if anyone would teach me. But as I have failed either to
<br>discover myself or to learn of anyone else, the nature of the best,
<br>I will exhibit to you, if you like, what I have found to be the second
<br>best mode of inquiring into the cause.
<br>&nbsp; I should very much like to hear that, he replied.
<br>&nbsp; Socrates proceeded: I thought that as I had failed in the
<br>contemplation of true existence, I ought to be careful that I did
<br>not lose the eye of my soul; as people may injure their bodily eye
<br>by observing and gazing on the sun during an eclipse, unless they take
<br>the precaution of only looking at the image reflected in the water,
or
<br>in some similar medium. That occurred to me, and I was afraid that
<br>my soul might be blinded altogether if I looked at things with my eyes
<br>or tried by the help of the senses to apprehend them. And I thought
<br>that I had better have recourse to ideas, and seek in them the truth
<br>of existence. I dare say that the simile is not perfect-for I am
<br>very far from admitting that he who contemplates existence through
the
<br>medium of ideas, sees them only "through a glass darkly," any more
<br>than he who sees them in their working and effects. However, this
<br>was the method which I adopted: I first assumed some principle which
I
<br>judged to be the strongest, and then I affirmed as true whatever
<br>seemed to agree with this, whether relating to the cause or to
<br>anything else; and that which disagreed I regarded as untrue. But I
<br>should like to explain my meaning clearly, as I do not think that
<br>you understand me.
<br>&nbsp; No, indeed, replied Cebes, not very well.
<p><b>(final immortality argument)</b>
<br>&nbsp; There is nothing new, he said, in what I am about to tell you;
but
<br>only what I have been always and everywhere repeating in the
<br>previous discussion and on other occasions: I want to show you the
<br>nature of that cause which has occupied my thoughts, and I shall
<br>have to go back to those familiar words which are in the mouth of
<br>everyone, and first of all assume that there is an absolute beauty
and
<br>goodness and greatness, and the like; grant me this, and I hope to
<br>be able to show you the nature of the cause, and to prove the
<br>immortality of the soul.
<br>&nbsp; Cebes said: You may proceed at once with the proof, as I readily
<br>grant you this.
<br>&nbsp; Well, he said, then I should like to know whether you agree
with
<br>me in the next step; for I cannot help thinking that if there be
<br>anything beautiful other than absolute beauty, that can only be
<br>beautiful in as far as it partakes of absolute beauty-and this I
<br>should say of everything. Do you agree in this notion of the cause?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, he said, I agree.
<br>&nbsp; He proceeded: I know nothing and can understand nothing of any
other
<br>of those wise causes which are alleged; and if a person says to me
<br>that the bloom of color, or form, or anything else of that sort is
a
<br>source of beauty, I leave all that, which is only confusing to me,
and
<br>simply and singly, and perhaps foolishly, hold and am assured in my
<br>own mind that nothing makes a thing beautiful but the presence and
<br>participation of beauty in whatever way or manner obtained; for as
<br>to the manner I am uncertain, but I stoutly contend that by beauty
all
<br>beautiful things become beautiful. That appears to me to be the only
<br>safe answer that I can give, either to myself or to any other, and
<br>to that I cling, in the persuasion that I shall never be overthrown,
<br>and that I may safely answer to myself or any other that by beauty
<br>beautiful things become beautiful. Do you not agree to that?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, I agree.
<br>&nbsp; And that by greatness only great things become great and greater
<br>greater, and by smallness the less becomes less.
<br>&nbsp; True.
<br>&nbsp; Then if a person remarks that A is taller by a head than B,
and B
<br>less by a head than A, you would refuse to admit this, and would
<br>stoutly contend that what you mean is only that the greater is greater
<br>by, and by reason of, greatness, and the less is less only by, or by
<br>reason of, smallness; and thus you would avoid the danger of saying
<br>that the greater is greater and the less by the measure of the head,
<br>which is the same in both, and would also avoid the monstrous
<br>absurdity of supposing that the greater man is greater by reason of
<br>the head, which is small. Would you not be afraid of that?
<br>&nbsp; Indeed, I should, said Cebes, laughing.
<br>&nbsp; In like manner you would be afraid to say that ten exceeded
eight
<br>by, and by reason of, two; but would say by, and by reason of, number;
<br>or that two cubits exceed one cubit not by a half, but by
<br>magnitude?-that is what you would say, for there is the same danger
in
<br>both cases.
<br>&nbsp; Very true, he said.
<br>&nbsp; Again, would you not be cautious of affirming that the addition
of
<br>one to one, or the division of one, is the cause of two? And you would
<br>loudly asseverate that you know of no way in which anything comes into
<br>existence except by participation in its own proper essence, and
<br>consequently, as far as you know, the only cause of two is the
<br>participation in duality; that is the way to make two, and the
<br>participation in one is the way to make one. You would say: I will
let
<br>alone puzzles of division and addition-wiser heads than mine may
<br>answer them; inexperienced as I am, and ready to start, as the proverb
<br>says, at my own shadow, I cannot afford to give up the sure ground
<br>of a principle. And if anyone assails you there, you would not mind
<br>him, or answer him until you had seen whether the consequences which
<br>follow agree with one another or not, and when you are further
<br>required to give an explanation of this principle, you would go on
<br>to assume a higher principle, and the best of the higher ones, until
<br>you found a resting-place; but you would not refuse the principle
<br>and the consequences in your reasoning like the Eristics-at least if
<br>you wanted to discover real existence. Not that this confusion
<br>signifies to them who never care or think about the matter at all,
for
<br>they have the wit to be well pleased with themselves, however great
<br>may be the turmoil of their ideas. But you, if you are a
<br>philosopher, will, I believe, do as I say.
<br>&nbsp; What you say is most true, said Simmias and Cebes, both speaking
<br>at once.
<br>&nbsp; Ech. Yes, Phaedo; and I don't wonder at their assenting. Anyone
<br>who has the least sense will acknowledge the wonderful clear. of
<br>Socrates' reasoning.
<br>&nbsp; Phaed. Certainly, Echecrates; and that was the feeling of the
<br>whole company at the time.
<br>&nbsp; Ech. Yes, and equally of ourselves, who were not of the company,
and
<br>are now listening to your recital. But what followed?
<br>&nbsp; Phaedo. After all this was admitted, and they had agreed about
the
<br>existence of ideas and the participation in them of the other things
<br>which derive their names from them, Socrates, if I remember rightly,
<br>said:-
<br>&nbsp; This is your way of speaking; and yet when you say that Simmias
is
<br>greater than Socrates and less than Phaedo, do you not predicate of
<br>Simmias both greatness and smallness?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, I do.
<br>&nbsp; But still you allow that Simmias does not really exceed Socrates,
as
<br>the words may seem to imply, because he is Simmias, but by reason of
<br>the size which he has; just as Simmias does not exceed Socrates
<br>because he is Simmias, any more than because Socrates is Socrates,
but
<br>because he has smallness when compared with the greatness of Simmias?
<br>&nbsp; True.
<br>&nbsp; And if Phaedo exceeds him in size, that is not because Phaedo
is
<br>Phaedo, but because Phaedo has greatness relatively to Simmias, who
is
<br>comparatively smaller?
<br>&nbsp; That is true.
<br>&nbsp; And therefore Simmias is said to be great, and is also said
to be
<br>small, because he is in a mean between them, exceeding the smallness
<br>of the one by his greatness, and allowing the greatness of the other
<br>to exceed his smallness. He added, laughing, I am speaking like a
<br>book, but I believe that what I am now saying is true.
<br>&nbsp; Simmias assented to this.
<br>&nbsp; The reason why I say this is that I want you to agree with me
in
<br>thinking, not only that absolute greatness will never be great and
<br>also small, but that greatness in us or in the concrete will never
<br>admit the small or admit of being exceeded: instead of this, one of
<br>two things will happen-either the greater will fly or retire before
<br>the opposite, which is the less, or at the advance of the less will
<br>cease to exist; but will not, if allowing or admitting smallness, be
<br>changed by that; even as I, having received and admitted smallness
<br>when compared with Simmias, remain just as I was, and am the same
<br>small person. And as the idea of greatness cannot condescend ever to
<br>be or become small, in like manner the smallness in us cannot be or
<br>become great; nor can any other opposite which remains the same ever
<br>be or become its own opposite, but either passes away or perishes in
<br>the change.
<br>&nbsp; That, replied Cebes, is quite my notion.
<br>&nbsp; One of the company, though I do not exactly remember which of
<br>them, on hearing this, said: By Heaven, is not this the direct
<br>contrary of what was admitted before-that out of the greater came
<br>the less and out of the less the greater, and that opposites are
<br>simply generated from opposites; whereas now this seems to be
<br>utterly denied.
<br>&nbsp; Socrates inclined his head to the speaker and listened. I like
<br>your courage, he said, in reminding us of this. But you do not observe
<br>that there is a difference in the two cases. For then we were speaking
<br>of opposites in the concrete, and now of the essential opposite which,
<br>as is affirmed, neither in us nor in nature can ever be at variance
<br>with itself: then, my friend, we were speaking of things in which
<br>opposites are inherent and which are called after them, but now
<br>about the opposites which are inherent in them and which give their
<br>name to them; these essential opposites will never, as we maintain,
<br>admit of generation into or out of one another. At the same time,
<br>turning to Cebes, he said: Were you at all disconcerted, Cebes, at
our
<br>friend's objection?
<br>&nbsp; That was not my feeling, said Cebes; and yet I cannot deny that
I am
<br>apt to be disconcerted.
<br>&nbsp; Then we are agreed after all, said Socrates, that the opposite
<br>will never in any case be opposed to itself?
<br>&nbsp; To that we are quite agreed, he replied.
<br>&nbsp; Yet once more let me ask you to consider the question from another
<br>point of view, and see whether you agree with me: There is a thing
<br>which you term heat, and another thing which you term cold?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly.
<br>&nbsp; But are they the same as fire and snow?
<br>&nbsp; Most assuredly not.
<br>&nbsp; Heat is not the same as fire, nor is cold the same as snow?
<br>&nbsp; No.
<br>&nbsp; And yet you will surely admit that when snow, as before said,
is
<br>under the influence of heat, they will not remain snow and heat; but
<br>at the advance of the heat the snow will either retire or perish?
<br>&nbsp; Very true, he replied.
<br>&nbsp; And the fire too at the advance of the cold will either retire
or
<br>perish; and when the fire is under the influence of the cold, they
<br>will not remain, as before, fire and cold.
<br>&nbsp; That is true, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And in some cases the name of the idea is not confined to the
<br>idea; but anything else which, not being the idea, exists only in
<br>the form of the idea, may also lay claim to it. I will try to make
<br>this clearer by an example: The odd number is always called by the
<br>name of odd?
<br>&nbsp; Very true.
<br>&nbsp; But is this the only thing which is called odd? Are there not
<br>other things which have their own name, and yet are called odd,
<br>because, although not the same as oddness, they are never without
<br>oddness?-that is what I mean to ask-whether numbers such as the number
<br>three are not of the class of odd. And there are many other
<br>examples: would you not say, for example, that three may be called
<br>by its proper name, and also be called odd, which is not the same with
<br>three? and this may be said not only of three but also of five, and
<br>every alternate number-each of them without being oddness is odd,
<br>and in the same way two and four, and the whole series of alternate
<br>numbers, has every number even, without being evenness. Do you admit
<br>that?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, he said, how can I deny that?
<br>&nbsp; Then now mark the point at which I am aiming: not only do
<br>essential opposites exclude one another, but also concrete things,
<br>which, although not in themselves opposed, contain opposites; these,
I
<br>say, also reject the idea which is opposed to that which is
<br>contained in them, and at the advance of that they either perish or
<br>withdraw. There is the number three for example; will not that
<br>endure annihilation or anything sooner than be converted into an
<br>even number, remaining three?
<br>&nbsp; Very true, said Cebes.
<br>&nbsp; And yet, he said, the number two is certainly not opposed to
the
<br>number three?
<br>&nbsp; It is not.
<br>&nbsp; Then not only do opposite ideas repel the advance of one another,
<br>but also there are other things which repel the approach of opposites.
<br>&nbsp; That is quite true, he said.
<br>&nbsp; Suppose, he said, that we endeavor, if possible, to determine
what
<br>these are.
<br>&nbsp; By all means.
<br>&nbsp; Are they not, Cebes, such as compel the things of which they
have
<br>possession, not only to take their own form, but also the form of some
<br>opposite?
<br>&nbsp; What do you mean?
<br>&nbsp; I mean, as I was just now saying, and have no need to repeat
to you,
<br>that those things which are possessed by the number three must not
<br>only be three in number, but must also be odd.
<br>&nbsp; Quite true.
<br>&nbsp; And on this oddness, of which the number three has the impress,
<br>the opposite idea will never intrude?
<br>&nbsp; No.
<br>&nbsp; And this impress was given by the odd principle?
<br>&nbsp; Yes.
<br>&nbsp; And to the odd is opposed the even?
<br>&nbsp; True.
<br>&nbsp; Then the idea of the even number will never arrive at three?
<br>&nbsp; No.
<br>&nbsp; Then three has no part in the even?
<br>&nbsp; None.
<br>&nbsp; Then the triad or number three is uneven?
<br>&nbsp; Very true.
<br>&nbsp; To return then to my distinction of natures which are not opposites,
<br>and yet do not admit opposites: as, in this instance, three,
<br>although not opposed to the even, does not any the more admit of the
<br>even, but always brings the opposite into play on the other side; or
<br>as two does not receive the odd, or fire the cold-from these
<br>examples (and there are many more of them) perhaps you may be able
<br>to arrive at the general conclusion that not only opposites will not
<br>receive opposites, but also that nothing which brings the opposite
<br>will admit the opposite of that which it brings in that to which it
is
<br>brought. And here let me recapitulate-for there is no harm in
<br>repetition. The number five will not admit the nature of the even,
any
<br>more than ten, which is the double of five, will admit the nature of
<br>the odd-the double, though not strictly opposed to the odd, rejects
<br>the odd altogether. Nor again will parts in the ratio of 3:2, nor
<br>any fraction in which there is a half, nor again in which there is
a
<br>third, admit the notion of the whole, although they are not opposed
to
<br>the whole. You will agree to that?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, he said, I entirely agree and go along with you in that.
<br>&nbsp; And now, he said, I think that I may begin again; and to the
<br>question which I am about to ask I will beg you to give not the old
<br>safe answer, but another, of which I will offer you an example; and
<br>I hope that you will find in what has been just said another
<br>foundation which is as safe. I mean that if anyone asks you "what that
<br>is, the inherence of which makes the body hot," you will reply not
<br>heat (this is what I call the safe and stupid answer), but fire, a
far
<br>better answer, which we are now in a condition to give. Or if anyone
<br>asks you "why a body is diseased," you will not say from disease,
<br>but from fever; and instead of saying that oddness is the cause of
odd
<br>numbers, you will say that the monad is the cause of them: and so of
<br>things in general, as I dare say that you will understand sufficiently
<br>without my adducing any further examples.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, he said, I quite understand you.
<br>&nbsp; Tell me, then, what is that the inherence of which will render
the
<br>body alive?
<br>&nbsp; The soul, he replied.
<br>&nbsp; And is this always the case?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, he said, of course.
<br>&nbsp; Then whatever the soul possesses, to that she comes bearing
life?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, certainly.
<br>&nbsp; And is there any opposite to life?
<br>&nbsp; There is, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And what is that?
<br>&nbsp; Death.
<br>&nbsp; Then the soul, as has been acknowledged, will never receive
the
<br>opposite of what she brings. And now, he said, what did we call that
<br>principle which repels the even?
<br>&nbsp; The odd.
<br>&nbsp; And that principle which repels the musical, or the just?
<br>&nbsp; The unmusical, he said, and the unjust.
<br>&nbsp; And what do we call the principle which does not admit of death?
<br>&nbsp; The immortal, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And does the soul admit of death?
<br>&nbsp; No.
<br>&nbsp; Then the soul is immortal?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And may we say that this is proven?
<br>&nbsp; Yes, abundantly proven, Socrates, he replied.
<br>&nbsp; And supposing that the odd were imperishable, must not three
be
<br>imperishable?
<br>&nbsp; Of course.
<br>&nbsp; And if that which is cold were imperishable, when the warm principle
<br>came attacking the snow, must not the snow have retired whole and
<br>unmelted-for it could never have perished, nor could it have
<br>remained and admitted the heat?
<br>&nbsp; True, he said.
<br>&nbsp; Again, if the uncooling or warm principle were imperishable,
the
<br>fire when assailed by cold would not have perished or have been
<br>extinguished, but would have gone away unaffected?
<br>&nbsp; Certainly, he said.
<br>&nbsp; And the same may be said of the immortal: if the immortal is
also
<br>imperishable, the soul when attacked by death cannot perish; for the
<br>preceding argument shows that the soul will not admit of death, or
<br>ever be dead, any more than three or the odd number will admit of
<br>the even, or fire or the heat in the fire, of the cold. Yet a person
<br>may say: "But although the odd will not become even at the approach
of
<br>the even, why may not the odd perish and the even take the place of
<br>the odd?" Now to him who makes this objection, we cannot answer that
<br>the odd principle is imperishable; for this has not been acknowledged,
<br>but if this had been acknowledged, there would have been no difficulty
<br>in contending that at the approach of the even the odd principle and
<br>the number three took up their departure; and the same argument
<br>would have held good of fire and heat and any other thing.
<br>&nbsp; Very true.
<br>&nbsp; And the same may be said of the immortal: if the immortal is
also
<br>imperishable, then the soul will be imperishable as well as
<br>immortal; but if not, some other proof of her imperishableness will
<br>have to be given.
<br>&nbsp; No other proof is needed, he said; for if the immortal, being
<br>eternal, is liable to perish, then nothing is imperishable.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, replied Socrates, all men will agree that God, and the
<br>essential form of life, and the immortal in general, will never
<br>perish.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, all men, he said-that is true; and what is more, gods,
if I
<br>am not mistaken, as well as men.
<br>&nbsp; Seeing then that the immortal is indestructible, must not the
<br>soul, if she is immortal, be also imperishable?
<br>&nbsp; Most certainly.
<br>&nbsp; Then when death attacks a man, the mortal portion of him may
be
<br>supposed to die, but the immortal goes out of the way of death and
<br>is preserved safe and sound?
<br>&nbsp; True.
<br>&nbsp; Then, Cebes, beyond question the soul is immortal and
<br>imperishable, and our souls will truly exist in another world!
<br>&nbsp; I am convinced, Socrates, said Cebes, and have nothing more
to
<br>object; but if my friend Simmias, or anyone else, has any further
<br>objection, he had better speak out, and not keep silence, since I do
<br>not know how there can ever be a more fitting time to which he can
<br>defer the discussion, if there is anything which he wants to say or
<br>have said.
<br>&nbsp; But I have nothing more to say, replied Simmias; nor do I see
any
<br>room for uncertainty, except that which arises necessarily out of
<br>the greatness of the subject and the feebleness of man, and which I
<br>cannot help feeling.
<br>&nbsp; Yes, Simmias, replied Socrates, that is well said: and more
than
<br>that, first principles, even if they appear certain, should be
<br>carefully considered; and when they are satisfactorily ascertained,
<br>then, with a sort of hesitating confidence in human reason, you may,
I
<br>think, follow the course of the argument; and if this is clear,
<br>there will be no need for any further inquiry.
<br>&nbsp; That, he said, is true.
<br>&nbsp; But then, O my friends, he said, if the soul is really immortal,
<br>what care should be taken of her, not only in respect of the portion
<br>of time which is called life, but of eternity! And the danger of
<br>neglecting her from this point of view does indeed appear to be awful.
<br>If death had only been the end of all, the wicked would have had a
<br>good bargain in dying, for they would have been happily quit not
<br>only of their body, but of their own evil together with their souls.
<br>But now, as the soul plainly appears to be immortal, there is no
<br>release or salvation from evil except the attainment of the highest
<br>virtue and wisdom. For the soul when on her progress to the world
<br>below takes nothing with her but nurture and education; which are
<br>indeed said greatly to benefit or greatly to injure the departed, at
<br>the very beginning of its pilgrimage in the other world.
<br>&nbsp; For after death, as they say, the genius of each individual,
to whom
<br>he belonged in life, leads him to a certain place in which the dead
<br>are gathered together for judgment, whence they go into the world
<br>below, following the guide who is appointed to conduct them from
<br>this world to the other: and when they have there received their due
<br>and remained their time, another guide brings them back again after
<br>many revolutions of ages. Now this journey to the other world is
<br>not, as Aeschylus says in the "Telephus," a single and straight
<br>path-no guide would be wanted for that, and no one could miss a single
<br>path; but there are many partings of the road, and windings, as I must
<br>infer from the rites and sacrifices which are offered to the gods
<br>below in places where three ways meet on earth. The wise and orderly
<br>soul is conscious of her situation and follows in the path; but the
<br>soul which desires the body, and which, as I was relating before,
<br>has long been fluttering about the lifeless frame and the world of
<br>sight, is after many struggles and many sufferings hardly and with
<br>violence carried away by her attendant genius, and when she arrives
at
<br>the place where the other souls are gathered, if she be impure and
<br>have done impure deeds, or been concerned in foul murders or other
<br>crimes which are the brothers of these, and the works of brothers in
<br>crime-from that soul everyone flees and turns away; no one will be
her
<br>companion, no one her guide, but alone she wanders in extremity of
<br>evil until certain times are fulfilled, and when they are fulfilled,
<br>she is borne irresistibly to her own fitting habitation; as every pure
<br>and just soul which has passed through life in the company and under
<br>the guidance of the gods has also her own proper home.
<br>&nbsp; Now the earth has divers wonderful regions, and is indeed in
<br>nature and extent very unlike the notions of geographers, as I believe
<br>on the authority of one who shall be nameless.
<br>&nbsp; What do you mean, Socrates? said Simmias. I have myself heard
many
<br>descriptions of the earth, but I do not know in what you are putting
<br>your faith, and I should like to know.
<br>&nbsp; Well, Simmias, replied Socrates, the recital of a tale does
not, I
<br>think, require the art of Glaucus; and I know not that the art of
<br>Glaucus could prove the truth of my tale, which I myself should
<br>never be able to prove, and even if I could, I fear, Simmias, that
<br>my life would come to an end before the argument was completed. I
<br>may describe to you, however, the form and regions of the earth
<br>according to my conception of them.
<br>&nbsp; That, said Simmias, will be enough.
<br>&nbsp; Well, then, he said, my conviction is that the earth is a round
body
<br>in the center of the heavens, and therefore has no need of air or
<br>any similar force as a support, but is kept there and hindered from
<br>falling or inclining any way by the equability of the surrounding
<br>heaven and by her own equipoise. For that which, being in equipoise,
<br>is in the center of that which is equably diffused, will not incline
<br>any way in any degree, but will always remain in the same state and
<br>not deviate. And this is my first notion.
<br>&nbsp; Which is surely a correct one, said Simmias.
<br>&nbsp; Also I believe that the earth is very vast, and that we who
dwell in
<br>the region extending from the river Phasis to the Pillars of Heracles,
<br>along the borders of the sea, are just like ants or frogs about a
<br>marsh, and inhabit a small portion only, and that many others dwell
in
<br>many like places. For I should say that in all parts of the earth
<br>there are hollows of various forms and sizes, into which the water
and
<br>the mist and the air collect; and that the true earth is pure and in
<br>the pure heaven, in which also are the stars-that is the heaven
<br>which is commonly spoken of as the ether, of which this is but the
<br>sediment collecting in the hollows of the earth. But we who live in
<br>these hollows are deceived into the notion that we are dwelling
<br>above on the surface of the earth; which is just as if a creature
<br>who was at the bottom of the sea were to fancy that he was on the
<br>surface of the water, and that the sea was the heaven through which
he
<br>saw the sun and the other stars-he having never come to the surface
by
<br>reason of his feebleness and sluggishness, and having never lifted
<br>up his head and seen, nor ever heard from one who had seen, this
<br>region which is so much purer and fairer than his own. Now this is
<br>exactly our case: for we are dwelling in a hollow of the earth, and
<br>fancy that we are on the surface; and the air we call the heaven,
<br>and in this we imagine that the stars move. But this is also owing
<br>to our feebleness and sluggishness, which prevent our reaching the
<br>surface of the air: for if any man could arrive at the exterior limit,
<br>or take the wings of a bird and fly upward, like a fish who puts his
<br>head out and sees this world, he would see a world beyond; and, if
the
<br>nature of man could sustain the sight, he would acknowledge that
<br>this was the place of the true heaven and the true light and the
<br>true stars. For this earth, and the stones, and the entire region
<br>which surrounds us, are spoilt and corroded, like the things in the
<br>sea which are corroded by the brine; for in the sea too there is
<br>hardly any noble or perfect growth, but clefts only, and sand, and
<br>an endless slough of mud: and even the shore is not to be compared
<br>to the fairer sights of this world. And greater far is the superiority
<br>of the other. Now of that upper earth which is under the heaven, I
can
<br>tell you a charming tale, Simmias, which is well worth hearing.
<br>&nbsp; And we, Socrates, replied Simmias, shall be charmed to listen.
<br>&nbsp; The tale, my friend, he said, is as follows: In the first place,
the
<br>earth, when looked at from above, is like one of those balls which
<br>have leather coverings in twelve pieces, and is of divers colors, of
<br>which the colors which painters use on earth are only a sample. But
<br>there the whole earth is made up of them, and they are brighter far
<br>and clearer than ours; there is a purple of wonderful luster, also
the
<br>radiance of gold, and the white which is in the earth is whiter than
<br>any chalk or snow. Of these and other colors the earth is made up,
and
<br>they are more in number and fairer than the eye of man has ever
<br>seen; and the very hollows (of which I was speaking) filled with air
<br>and water are seen like light flashing amid the other colors, and have
<br>a color of their own, which gives a sort of unity to the variety of
<br>earth. And in this fair region everything that grows-trees, and
<br>flowers, and fruits-is in a like degree fairer than any here; and
<br>there are hills, and stones in them in a like degree smoother, and
<br>more transparent, and fairer in color than our highly valued
<br>emeralds and sardonyxes and jaspers, and other gems, which are but
<br>minute fragments of them: for there all the stones are like our
<br>precious stones, and fairer still. The reason of this is that they
are
<br>pure, and not, like our precious stones, infected or corroded by the
<br>corrupt briny elements which coagulate among us, and which breed
<br>foulness and disease both in earth and stones, as well as in animals
<br>and plants. They are the jewels of the upper earth, which also
<br>shines with gold and silver and the like, and they are visible to
<br>sight and large and abundant and found in every region of the earth,
<br>and blessed is he who sees them. And upon the earth are animals and
<br>men, some in a middle region, others dwelling about the air as we
<br>dwell about the sea; others in islands which the air flows round, near
<br>the continent: and in a word, the air is used by them as the water
and
<br>the sea are by us, and the ether is to them what the air is to us.
<br>Moreover, the temperament of their seasons is such that they have no
<br>disease, and live much longer than we do, and have sight and hearing
<br>and smell, and all the other senses, in far greater perfection, in
the
<br>same degree that air is purer than water or the ether than air. Also
<br>they have temples and sacred places in which the gods really dwell,
<br>and they hear their voices and receive their answers, and are
<br>conscious of them and hold converse with them, and they see the sun,
<br>moon, and stars as they really are, and their other blessedness is
<br>of a piece with this.
<br>&nbsp; Such is the nature of the whole earth, and of the things which
are
<br>around the earth; and there are divers regions in the hollows on the
<br>face of the globe everywhere, some of them deeper and also wider
<br>than that which we inhabit, others deeper and with a narrower
<br>opening than ours, and some are shallower and wider; all have numerous
<br>perforations, and passages broad and narrow in the interior of the
<br>earth, connecting them with one another; and there flows into and
<br>out of them, as into basins, a vast tide of water, and huge
<br>subterranean streams of perennial rivers, and springs hot and cold,
<br>and a great fire, and great rivers of fire, and streams of liquid mud,
<br>thin or thick (like the rivers of mud in Sicily, and the
<br>lava-streams which follow them), and the regions about which they
<br>happen to flow are filled up with them. And there is a sort of swing
<br>in the interior of the earth which moves all this up and down. Now
the
<br>swing is in this wise: There is a chasm which is the vastest of them
<br>all, and pierces right through the whole earth; this is that which
<br>Homer describes in the words,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Far off, where is the inmost depth beneath the earth";
<p>and which he in other places, and many other poets, have called
<br>Tartarus. And the swing is caused by the streams flowing into and
<br>out of this chasm, and they each have the nature of the soil through
<br>which they flow. And the reason why the streams are always flowing
<br>in and out is that the watery element has no bed or bottom, and is
<br>surging and swinging up and down, and the surrounding wind and air
<br>do the same; they follow the water up and down, hither and thither,
<br>over the earth-just as in respiring the air is always in process of
<br>inhalation and exhalation; and the wind swinging with the water in
and
<br>out produces fearful and irresistible blasts: when the waters retire
<br>with a rush into the lower parts of the earth, as they are called,
<br>they flow through the earth into those regions, and fill them up as
<br>with the alternate motion of a pump, and then when they leave those
<br>regions and rush back hither, they again fill the hollows here, and
<br>when these are filled, flow through subterranean channels and find
<br>their way to their several places, forming seas, and lakes, and
<br>rivers, and springs. Thence they again enter the earth, some of them
<br>making a long circuit into many lands, others going to few places
<br>and those not distant, and again fall into Tartarus, some at a point
a
<br>good deal lower than that at which they rose, and others not much
<br>lower, but all in some degree lower than the point of issue. And
<br>some burst forth again on the opposite side, and some on the same
<br>side, and some wind round the earth with one or many folds, like the
<br>coils of a serpent, and descend as far as they can, but always
<br>return and fall into the lake. The rivers on either side can descend
<br>only to the center and no further, for to the rivers on both sides
the
<br>opposite side is a precipice.
<br>&nbsp; Now these rivers are many, and mighty, and diverse, and there
are
<br>four principal ones, of which the greatest and outermost is that
<br>called Oceanus, which flows round the earth in a circle; and in the
<br>opposite direction flows Acheron, which passes under the earth through
<br>desert places, into the Acherusian Lake: this is the lake to the
<br>shores of which the souls of the many go when they are dead, and after
<br>waiting an appointed time, which is to some a longer and to some a
<br>shorter time, they are sent back again to be born as animals. The
<br>third river rises between the two, and near the place of rising
<br>pours into a vast region of fire, and forms a lake larger than the
<br>Mediterranean Sea, boiling with water and mud; and proceeding muddy
<br>and turbid, and winding about the earth, comes, among other places,
to
<br>the extremities of the Acherusian Lake, but mingles not with the
<br>waters of the lake, and after making many coils about the earth
<br>plunges into Tartarus at a deeper level. This is that
<br>Pyriphlegethon, as the stream is called, which throws up jets of
<br>fire in all sorts of places. The fourth river goes out on the opposite
<br>side, and falls first of all into a wild and savage region, which is
<br>all of a dark-blue color, like lapis lazuli; and this is that river
<br>which is called the Stygian River, and falls into and forms the Lake
<br>Styx, and after falling into the lake and receiving strange powers
<br>in the waters, passes under the earth, winding round in the opposite
<br>direction to Pyriphlegethon, and meeting in the Acherusian Lake from
<br>the opposite side. And the water of this river too mingles with no
<br>other, but flows round in a circle and falls into Tartarus over
<br>against Pyriphlegethon, and the name of this river, as the poet
<br>says, is Cocytus.
<br>&nbsp; Such is the name of the other world; and when the dead arrive
at the
<br>place to which the genius of each severally conveys them, first of
all
<br>they have sentence passed upon them, as they have lived well and
<br>piously or not. And those who appear to have lived neither well nor
<br>ill, go to the river Acheron, and mount such conveyances as they can
<br>get, and are carried in them to the lake, and there they dwell&nbsp;
and
<br>are purified of their evil deeds, and suffer the penalty of the wrongs
<br>which they have done to others, and are absolved, and receive the
<br>rewards of their good deeds according to their deserts. But those
<br>who appear to be incurable by reason of the greatness of their
<br>crimes-who have committed many and terrible deeds of sacrilege,
<br>murders foul and violent, or the like-such are hurled into Tartarus,
<br>which is their suitable destiny, and they never come out. Those
<br>again who have committed crimes, which, although great, are not
<br>unpardonable-who in a moment of anger, for example, have done violence
<br>to a father or mother, and have repented for the remainder of their
<br>lives, or who have taken the life of another under like extenuating
<br>circumstances-these are plunged into Tartarus, the pains of which they
<br>are compelled to undergo for a year, but at the end of the year the
<br>wave casts them forth-mere homicides by way of Cocytus, parricides
and
<br>matricides by Pyriphlegethon-and they are borne to the Acherusian
<br>Lake, and there they lift up their voices and call upon the victims
<br>whom they have slain or wronged, to have pity on them, and to
<br>receive them, and to let them come out of the river into the lake.
And
<br>if they prevail, then they come forth and cease from their troubles;
<br>but if not, they are carried back again into Tartarus and from
<br>thence into the rivers unceasingly, until they obtain mercy from those
<br>whom they have wronged: for that is the sentence inflicted upon them
<br>by their judges. Those also who are remarkable for having led holy
<br>lives are released from this earthly prison, and go to their pure home
<br>which is above, and dwell in the purer earth; and those who have
<br>duly purified themselves with philosophy live henceforth altogether
<br>without the body, in mansions fairer far than these, which may not
<br>be described, and of which the time would fail me to tell.
<br>&nbsp; Wherefore, Simmias, seeing all these things, what ought not
we to do
<br>in order to obtain virtue and wisdom in this life? Fair is the
<br>prize, and the hope great.
<br>&nbsp; I do not mean to affirm that the description which I have given
of
<br>the soul and her mansions is exactly true-a man of sense ought
<br>hardly to say that. But I do say that, inasmuch as the soul is shown
<br>to be immortal, he may venture to think, not improperly or unworthily,
<br>that something of the kind is true. The venture is a glorious one,
and
<br>he ought to comfort himself with words like these, which is the reason
<br>why lengthen out the tale. Wherefore, I say, let a man be of good
<br>cheer about his soul, who has cast away the pleasures and ornaments
of
<br>the body as alien to him, and rather hurtful in their effects, and
has
<br>followed after the pleasures of knowledge in this life; who has
<br>adorned the soul in her own proper jewels, which are temperance, and
<br>justice, and courage, and nobility, and truth-in these arrayed she
<br>is ready to go on her journey to the world below, when her time comes.
<br>You, Simmias and Cebes, and all other men, will depart at some time
or
<br>other. Me already, as the tragic poet would say, the voice of fate
<br>calls. Soon I must drink the poison; and I think that I had better
<br>repair to the bath first, in order that the women may not have the
<br>trouble of washing my body after I am dead.
<br>&nbsp; When he had done speaking, Crito said: And have you any commands
for
<br>us, Socrates-anything to say about your children, or any other
<br>matter in which we can serve you?
<br>&nbsp; Nothing particular, he said: only, as I have always told you,
I
<br>would have you look to yourselves; that is a service which you may
<br>always be doing to me and mine as well as to yourselves. And you
<br>need not make professions; for if you take no thought for
<br>yourselves, and walk not according to the precepts which I have
<br>given you, not now for the first time, the warmth of your
<br>professions will be of no avail.
<br>&nbsp; We will do our best, said Crito. But in what way would you have
us
<br>bury you?
<br>&nbsp; In any way that you like; only you must get hold of me, and
take
<br>care that I do not walk away from you. Then he turned to us, and added
<br>with a smile: I cannot make Crito believe that I am the same
<br>Socrates who have been talking and conducting the argument; he fancies
<br>that I am the other Socrates whom he will soon see, a dead body-and
he
<br>asks, How shall he bury me? And though I have spoken many words in
the
<br>endeavor to show that when I have drunk the poison I shall leave you
<br>and go to the joys of the blessed-these words of mine, with which I
<br>comforted you and myself, have had, I perceive, no effect upon
<br>Crito. And therefore I want you to be surety for me now, as he was
<br>surety for me at the trial: but let the promise be of another sort;
<br>for he was my surety to the judges that I would remain, but you must
<br>be my surety to him that I shall not remain, but go away and depart;
<br>and then he will suffer less at my death, and not be grieved when he
<br>sees my body being burned or buried. I would not have him sorrow at
my
<br>hard lot, or say at the burial, Thus we lay out Socrates, or, Thus
<br>we follow him to the grave or bury him; for false words are not only
<br>evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil. Be of good
<br>cheer, then, my dear Crito, and say that you are burying my body only,
<br>and do with that as is usual, and as you think best.
<br>&nbsp; When he had spoken these words, he arose and went into the bath
<br>chamber with Crito, who bade us wait; and we waited, talking and
<br>thinking of the subject of discourse, and also of the greatness of
our
<br>sorrow; he was like a father of whom we were being bereaved, and we
<br>were about to pass the rest of our lives as orphans. When he had taken
<br>the bath his children were brought to him-(he had two young sons and
<br>an elder one); and the women of his family also came, and he talked
to
<br>them and gave them a few directions in the presence of Crito; and he
<br>then dismissed them and returned to us.
<br>&nbsp; Now the hour of sunset was near, for a good deal of time had
<br>passed while he was within. When he came out, he sat down with us
<br>again after his bath, but not much was said. Soon the jailer, who
<br>was the servant of the Eleven, entered and stood by him, saying: To
<br>you, Socrates, whom I know to be the noblest and gentlest and best
<br>of all who ever came to this place, I will not impute the angry
<br>feelings of other men, who rage and swear at me when, in obedience
<br>to the authorities, I bid them drink the poison-indeed, I am sure that
<br>you will not be angry with me; for others, as you are aware, and not
<br>I, are the guilty cause. And so fare you well, and try to bear lightly
<br>what must needs be; you know my errand. Then bursting into tears he
<br>turned away and went out.
<br>&nbsp; Socrates looked at him and said: I return your good wishes,
and will
<br>do as you bid. Then, turning to us, he said, How charming the man
<br>is: since I have been in prison he has always been coming to see me,
<br>and at times he would talk to me, and was as good as could be to me,
<br>and now see how generously he sorrows for me. But we must do as he
<br>says, Crito; let the cup be brought, if the poison is prepared: if
<br>not, let the attendant prepare some.
<br>&nbsp; Yet, said Crito, the sun is still upon the hilltops, and many
a
<br>one has taken the draught late, and after the announcement has been
<br>made to him, he has eaten and drunk, and indulged in sensual delights;
<br>do not hasten then, there is still time.
<br>&nbsp; Socrates said: Yes, Crito, and they of whom you speak are right
in
<br>doing thus, for they think that they will gain by the delay; but I
<br>am right in not doing thus, for I do not think that I should gain
<br>anything by drinking the poison a little later; I should be sparing
<br>and saving a life which is already gone: I could only laugh at
<br>myself for this. Please then to do as I say, and not to refuse me.
<br>&nbsp; Crito, when he heard this, made a sign to the servant, and the
<br>servant went in, and remained for some time, and then returned with
<br>the jailer carrying a cup of poison. Socrates said: You, my good
<br>friend, who are experienced in these matters, shall give me directions
<br>how I am to proceed. The man answered: You have only to walk about
<br>until your legs are heavy, and then to lie down, and the poison will
<br>act. At the same time he handed the cup to Socrates, who in the
<br>easiest and gentlest manner, without the least fear or change of color
<br>or feature, looking at the man with all his eyes, Echecrates, as his
<br>manner was, took the cup and said: What do you say about making a
<br>libation out of this cup to any god? May I, or not? The man
<br>answered: We only prepare, Socrates, just so much as we deem enough.
I
<br>understand, he said: yet I may and must pray to the gods to prosper
my
<br>journey from this to that other world-may this, then, which is my
<br>prayer, be granted to me. Then holding the cup to his lips, quite
<br>readily and cheerfully he drank off the poison. And hitherto most of
<br>us had been able to control our sorrow; but now when we saw him
<br>drinking, and saw too that he had finished the draught, we could no
<br>longer forbear, and in spite of myself my own tears were flowing fast;
<br>so that I covered my face and wept over myself, for certainly I was
<br>not weeping over him, but at the thought of my own calamity in
<br>having lost such a companion. Nor was I the first, for Crito, when
<br>he found himself unable to restrain his tears, had got up and moved
<br>away, and I followed; and at that moment. Apollodorus, who had been
<br>weeping all the time, broke out in a loud cry which made cowards of
us
<br>all. Socrates alone retained his calmness: What is this strange
<br>outcry? he said. I sent away the women mainly in order that they might
<br>not offend in this way, for I have heard that a man should die in
<br>peace. Be quiet, then, and have patience.
<br>&nbsp; When we heard that, we were ashamed, and refrained our tears;
and he
<br>walked about until, as he said, his legs began to fail, and then he
<br>lay on his back, according to the directions, and the man who gave
him
<br>the poison now and then looked at his feet and legs; and after a while
<br>he pressed his foot hard and asked him if he could feel; and he
<br>said, no; and then his leg, and so upwards and upwards, and showed
<br>us that he was cold and stiff. And he felt them himself, and said:
<br>When the poison reaches the heart, that will be the end. He was
<br>beginning to grow cold about the groin, when he uncovered his face,
<br>for he had covered himself up, and said (they were his last
<br>words)-he said: Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; will you remember
to
<br>pay the debt? The debt shall be paid, said Crito; is there anything
<br>else? There was no answer to this question; but in a minute or two
a
<br>movement was heard, and the attendants uncovered him; his eyes were
<br>set, and Crito closed his eyes and mouth.
<br>&nbsp; Such was the end, Echecrates, of our friend, whom I may truly
call
<br>the wisest, and justest, and best of all the men whom I have ever
<br>known.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-THE END-
<br>.
