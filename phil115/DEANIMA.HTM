<font size=+1>Aristotle: from<i> On the Soul </i>(<i>De Anima</i>) Bk.2,ch.1</font>
<p>...let us now make as it were a completely fresh start, endeavouring
to answer the question, What is soul? i.e. to formulate the most general
possible account of it.
<p>We say that <b>substance</b> is one kind of thing, and in several senses:i
n the sense of <b>matter</b> or that which in itself is not something definite,
and in the sense of <b>form</b> or essence, which is that precisely in
virtue of which a thing is definite, and thirdly in the sense of that which
is <b>compounded of both</b>. Now <b>matter </b>is <b>potentiality</b>,and
<b>form </b>is<b> actuality</b>; and actuality is of two kinds,one as e.g.
knowledge, the other as e.g. reflecting.
<p>{The following paragraph is the basis for the diagram concerning Aristotle's
view of the world--"Aristotle's Ontology"-- see if you can makethe connection
yourself.}
<p>Among<b> substances</b> are by general consent reckoned bodies and especially
<b>natural</b> bodies; for they are the principles of all other bodies.Of
natural bodies some have <b>life </b>in them, others not; by life we mean
self-nutrition and growth and decay. It follows that every <b>natural body</b>
which has life in it is a <b>substance</b> in the sense of a <b>composite.</b>
<p>Now given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having
life, <b>the soul cannot be a body</b>; for the body is the subject ormatter,
not what is attributed to it. Hence <b>the soul must be a substance in
the sense of the form of a natural body having life potentially within
it</b>. But substance is actuality, and thus soul is the actuality of a
body as above characterized. Now there are two kinds of actuality corresponding
to knowledge and to reflecting. It is obvious that <b>the soul is an actuality
like knowledge</b>; for both sleeping and waking presuppose the existenceof
soul, and of these waking corresponds to reflecting, sleeping to knowledge
possessed but not employed, and knowledge of something is temporally prior.
<p>That is why <b>the soul is an actuality of the first kind of a naturalbody
having life potentially in it</b>. The body so described is a body which
is organized. The parts of plants in spite of their extreme simplicity
are organs; e.g. the leaf serves to shelter the pericarp, the pericarp
to shelter the fruit, while the roots of plants are analogous to the mouthof
animals, both serving for the absorption of food. If, then, we have to
give a general formula applicable to all kinds of soul, <b>we must describeit
as an actuality of the first kind of a natural organized body</b>. That
is why we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and
the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its
shape are one, or generally the matter of a thing and that of which itis
the matter. Unity has many senses (as many as 'is' has), but the properone
is that of actuality.
<p>We have now given a general answer to the question, What is soul? Itis
substance in the sense which corresponds to the account of a thing. That
means that it is what it is to be for a body of the character just assigned.
Suppose that a tool, e.g. an axe, were a natural body, then <b>being an
axe would have been its essence, and so its soul</b>; if this disappeared
from it, it would have ceased to be an axe, except in name. As it is, itis
an axe; for it is not of a body of that sort that what it is to be, i.e.
its account, is a soul, but of <b>a natural body of a particular kind,
viz. one having in itself the power of setting itself in movement and arresting
itself....</b>
