Below is an excerpt from John Paul II's "<i>On the Dignity and Vocation
of Women</i>."
<br>&nbsp;
<p>18. In order to share in this "vision," we must once again seek a deeper
<br>understanding of the truth about the human person recalled by the Second
<br>Vatican Council. The human being--both male and female--is the only
being
<br>in the world which God willed for its own sake. The human being is
a
<br>person, a subject who decides for himself. At the same time, man "cannot
<br>fully find himself except through a sincere gift of self."[39] It has
<br>already been said that this description, indeed this definition of
the
<br>person, corresponds to the fundamental biblical truth about the creation
<br>of the human being--man and woman--in the image and likeness of God.
This
<br>is not a purely theoretical interpretation, nor an abstract definition,
<br>for it gives an essential indication of what it means to be human,
while
<br>emphasizing the value of the gift of self, the gift of the person.
In
<br>this vision of the person we also find the essence of that "ethos"
which,
<br>together with the truth of creation, will be fully developed by the
books
<br>of Revelation, particularly the Gospels.
<p>This truth about the person also opens up the path to a full
<br>understanding of women's motherhood. Motherhood is the fruit of the
<br>marriage union of a man and woman, of that biblical "knowledge" which
<br>corresponds to the "union of the two in one flesh" (cf. Gen 2:24).
This
<br>brings about--on the woman's part--a special "gift of self," as an
<br>expression of that spousal love whereby the two are united to each
other
<br>so closely that they become "one flesh." Biblical "knowledge" is achieved
<br>in accordance with the truth of the person only when the mutual self
<br>giving is not distorted either by the desire of the man to become the
<br>"master" of his wife ("he shall rule over you") or by the woman remaining
<br>closed within her own instincts ("your desire shall be for your husband,"
<br>Gen 3:16).
<p>This mutual gift of the person in marriage opens to the gift of a new
<br>life, a new human being, who is also a person in the likeness of his
<br>parents. Motherhood implies from the beginning a special openness to
the
<br>new person: and this is precisely the woman's "part." In this openness,
<br>in conceiving and giving birth to a child, the woman "discovers herself
<br>through a sincere gift of self." The gift of interior readiness to
accept
<br>the child and bring it into the world is linked to the marriage union,
<br>which--as mentioned earlier--should constitute a special moment in
the
<br>mutual self-giving both by the woman and the man. According to the
Bible,
<br>the conception and birth of a new human being are accompanied by the
<br>following words of the woman: "I have brought a man into being with
the
<br>help of the Lord" (Gen 4:1). This exclamation of Eve, the "mother of
all
<br>the living" is repeated every time a new human being comes into the
<br>world. It expresses the woman's joy and awareness that she is sharing
in
<br>the great mystery of eternal generation. The spouses share in the
<br>creative power of God!
<p>The woman's motherhood in the period between the baby's conception and
<br>birth is a biophysiological and psychological process which is better
<br>understood in our days than in the past, and is the subject of many
<br>detailed studies. Scientific analysis fully confirms that the very
<br>physical constitution of women is naturally disposed to
<br>motherhood--conception, pregnancy and giving birth--which is a
<br>consequence of the marriage union with the man. At the same time, this
<br>also corresponds to the psycho-physical structure of women. What the
<br>different branches of science have to say on this subject is important
<br>and useful, provided that it is not limited to an exclusively
<br>biophysiological interpretation of women and of motherhood. Such a
<br>"restricted" picture would go hand in hand with a materialistic concept
<br>of the human being and of the world. In such a case, what is truly
<br>essential would unfortunately be lost. Motherhood as a human fact and
<br>phenomenon is fully explained on the basis of the truth about the person.
<br>Motherhood is linked to the personal structure of the woman and to
the
<br>personal dimension of the gift: "I have brought a man into being with
the
<br>help of the Lord" (Gen 4:1). The Creator grants the parents the gift
of a
<br>child. On the woman's part, this fact is linked in a special way to
"a
<br>sincere gift of self." Mary's words at the Annunciation--"Let it be
to me
<br>according to your word" signify the woman's readiness for the gift
of
<br>self and her readiness to accept a new life.
<p>The eternal mystery of generation, which is in God himself, the one
and
<br>Triune God (cf. Eph 3:14-15), is reflected in the woman's motherhood
and
<br>in the man's fatherhood. Human parenthood is something shared by both
the
<br>man and the woman. Even if the woman, out of love for her husband,
says:
<br>"I have given you a child," her words also mean: "This is our child."
<br>Although both of them together are parents of their child, the woman's
<br>motherhood constitutes a special 'part" in this shared parenthood,
and
<br>the most demanding part. Parenthood--even though it belongs to both--is
<br>realized much more fully in the woman, especially in the prenatal period.
<br>It is the woman who "pays" directly for this shared generation, which
<br>literally absorbs the energies of her body and soul. It is therefore
<br>necessary that the man be fully aware that in their shared parenthood
he
<br>owes a special debt to the woman. No program of "equal rights" between
<br>women and men is valid unless it takes this fact fully into account.
<p>Motherhood involves a special communion with the mystery of life, as
it
<br>develops in the woman's womb. The mother is filled with wonder at this
<br>mystery of life, and "understands" with unique intuition what is
<br>happening inside her. In the light of the "beginning," the mother accepts
<br>and loves as a person the child she is carrying in her womb. This unique
<br>contact with the new human being developing within her gives rise to
an
<br>attitude towards human beings--not only towards her own child, but
every
<br>human being--which profoundly marks the woman's personality. It is
<br>commonly thought that women are more capable than men of paying attention
<br>to another person, and that motherhood develops this predisposition
even
<br>more. The man--even with all his sharing in parenthood--always remains
<br>"outside" the process of pregnancy and the baby's birth; in many ways
he
<br>has to learn his own "fatherhood" from the mother. One can say that
this
<br>is part of the normal human dimension of parenthood, including the
stages
<br>that follow the birth of the baby, especially the initial period. The
<br>child's upbringing, taken as a whole, should include the contribution
of
<br>both parents: the maternal and paternal contribution. In any event,
the
<br>mother's contribution is decisive in laying the foundation for a new
<br>human personality.
