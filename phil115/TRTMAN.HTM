<P><B>Article 1: Whether the soul is a body?</B>

<P>OBJ 1: It would seem that the soul is a body. For the soul is the moving
principle of the body. Nor does it move unless moved. First, because seemingly
nothing can move unless it is itself moved, since nothing gives what it
has not; for instance, what is not hot does not give heat. Secondly, because
if there be anything that moves and is not moved, it must be the cause
of eternal, unchanging movement, as we find proved Phys. viii, 6; and this
does not appear to be the case in the movement of an animal, which is caused
by the soul. Therefore the soul is a mover moved. But every mover moved
is a body. Therefore the soul is a body.

<P><B>I answer that</B>, To seek the nature of the soul, we must assume
that the soul is defined as the first principle of life of those things
which live: for we call living things "animate," [*i.e. having a soul],
and those things which have no life, "inanimate." Now life is shown principally
by two actions, knowledge and movement. The philosophers of old, not being
able to rise above their imagination, supposed that the principle of these
actions was something corporeal: for they asserted that only bodies were
real things; and that what is not corporeal is nothing: hence they maintained
that the soul is something corporeal. This opinion can be proved to be
false in many ways; but we shall make use of only one proof, based on universal
and certain principles, which shows clearly that the soul is not a body.
It is manifest that not every principle of vital action is a soul, for
then the eye would be a soul, as it is a principle of vision; and the same
might be applied to the other instruments of the soul: but it is the "first"
principle of life, which we call the soul. Now, though a body may be a
principle of life, or to be a living thing, as the heart is a principle
of life in an animal, yet nothing corporeal can be the first principle
of life. For it is clear that to be a principle of life, or to be a living
thing, does not belong to a body as such; since, if that were the case,
every body would be a living thing, or a principle of life. Therefore a
body is disposed to be a living thing or even a principle of life, as "such"
a body. Now that it is actually such a body, it owes to some principle
which is called its act. Therefore the soul, which is the first principle
of life, is not a body, but the act of a body; thus heat, which is the
principle of calefaction, is not a body, but an act of a body.

<P>Reply OBJ 1: As everything which is in motion must be moved by something
else, a process which cannot be prolonged indefinitely, we must allow that
not every mover is moved. For, since to be moved is to pass from potentiality
to actuality, the mover gives what it has to the thing moved, inasmuch
as it causes it to be in act. But, as is shown in Phys. viii, 6, there
is a mover which is altogether immovable, and not moved either essentially,
or accidentally; and such a mover can cause an invariable movement. There
is, however, another kind of mover, which, though not moved essentially,
is moved accidentally; and for this reason it does not cause an invariable
movement; such a mover, is the soul. There is, again, another mover, which
is moved essentially namely, the body. And because the philosophers of
old believed that nothing existed but bodies, they maintained that every
mover is moved; and that the soul is moved directly, and is a body.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Article 2: Whether the human soul is something subsistent?</B>

<P>OBJ 3: Further, if the soul were subsistent, it would have some operation
apart from the body. But it has no operation apart from the body, not even
that of understanding: for the act of understanding does not take place
without a concept, which cannot exist apart from the body. Therefore the
human soul is not something subsistent. On the contrary, Augustine says
(De Trin. x, 7): "Who understands that the nature of the soul is that of
a substance and not that of a body, will see that those who maintain the
corporeal nature of the soul, are led astray through associating with the
soul those things without which they are unable to think of any nature
i.e. imaginary pictures of corporeal things." Therefore the nature of the
human intellect is not only incorporeal, but it is also a substance, that
is, something subsistent.

<P><B>I answer that</B>, It must necessarily be allowed that the principle
of intellectual operation which we call the soul, is a principle both incorporeal
and subsistent. For it is clear that by means of the intellect man can
have knowledge of all corporeal things. Now whatever knows certain things
cannot have any of them in its own nature; because that which is in it
naturally would impede the knowledge of anything else. Thus we observe
that a sick man's tongue being vitiated by a feverish and bitter humor,
is insensible to anything sweet, and everything seems bitter to it. Therefore,
if the intellectual principle contained the nature of a body it would be
unable to know all bodies. Now every body has its own determinate nature.
Therefore it is impossible for the intellectual principle to be a body.
It is likewise impossible for it to understand by means of a bodily organ;
since the determinate nature of that organ would impede knowledge of all
bodies; as when a certain determinate color is not only in the pupil of
the eye, but also in a glass vase, the liquid in the vase seems to be of
that same color. Therefore the intellectual principle which we call the
mind or the intellect has an operation "per se" apart from the body.

<P>Now only that which subsists can have an operation "per se." For nothing
can operate but what is actual: for which reason we do not say that heat
imparts heat, but that what is hot gives heat. We must conclude, therefore,
that the human soul, which is called the intellect or the mind, is something
incorporeal and subsistent.

<P>Reply OBJ 3: The body is necessary for the action of the intellect,
not as its origin of action, but on the part of the object; for the concept
is to the intellect what color is to the sight. Neither does such a dependence
on the body prove the intellect to be non subsistent; otherwise it would
follow that an animal is non subsistent, since it requires external objects
of the senses in order to perform its act of perception.

<P><B>Article 3: Whether the souls of brute animals are subsistent?</B>

<P>OBJ 2: Further, the relation of the sensitive faculty to sensible objects
is like the relation of the intellectual faculty to intelligible objects.
But the intellect, apart from the body, apprehends intelligible objects.
Therefore the sensitive faculty, apart from the body, perceives sensible
objects. Therefore, since the souls of brute animals are sensitive, it
follows that they are subsistent; just as the human intellectual soul is
subsistent.

<P><B>I answer that</B>, The ancient philosophers made no distinction between
sense and intellect, and referred both a material principle, as has been
said (A1). Plato, however, drew a distinction between intellect and sense;
yet he referred both to an immaterial principle, maintaining that sensing,
just as understanding, belongs to the soul as such. From this it follows
that even the souls of brute animals are subsistent. But Aristotle held
that of the operations of the soul, understanding alone is performed without
a physical organ. On the other hand, sensation and the consequent operations
of the sensitive soul are evidently accompanied with change in the body;
thus in the act of vision, the pupil of the eye is affected by a reflection
of color: and so with the other senses. Hence it is clear that the sensitive
soul has no "per se" operation of its own, and that every operation of
the sensitive soul belongs to the composite. Wherefore we conclude that
as the souls of brute animals have no "per se" operations they are not
subsistent. For the operation of anything follows the mode of its being.
(see handout)

<P>Reply OBJ 2: The relation of the sensitive faculty to the sensible object
is in one way the same as that of the intellectual faculty to the intelligible
object, in so far as each is in potentiality to its object. But in another
way their relations differ, inasmuch as the impression of the object on
the sense is accompanied with change in the body; so that excessive strength
of the sensible corrupts sense; a thing that never occurs in the case of
the intellect. For an intellect that understands the highest of intelligible
objects is more able afterwards to understand those that are lower. If,
however, in the process of intellectual operation the body is weary, this
result is accidental, inasmuch as the intellect requires the operation
of the sensitive powers in the production of the concepts.

<P><B>Article 4: Whether the soul is man? </B>{Aquinas is offering an argument
that amounts to showing that dualism is false. A dualist would offer an
affirmative response to the question Aquinas poses in this article. Aquinas
uses distinctions from the third article. Sensation is part of human nature
(this is how we acquire knowledge), and sensation involves both body and
soul. Therefore human nature must include the body. Article two allows
us to say that the soul is also part of our nature. Hence human beings
are a hylomorphic composite (composed of body and soul). So dualism can't
be right.}

<P><B>I answer that</B>... It may also be understood in this sense, that
this soul is this man; and this could be held if it were supposed (make
sure you set up this conditional!) that the operation of the sensitive
soul were proper to it, apart from the body; because in that case all the
operations which are attributed to man would belong to the soul only; and
whatever performs the operations proper to a thing, is that thing; wherefore
that which performs the operations of a man is man. But it has been shown
above (A3) that sensation is not the operation of the soul only. Since,
then, sensation is an operation of man, but not proper to him, it is clear
that man is not a soul only, but something composed of soul and body. Plato,
through supposing that sensation was proper to the soul, could maintain
man to be a soul making use of the body.

<P><B>Question 76: OF THE UNION OF BODY AND SOUL</B>

<P><B>Article 1: Whether the intellectual principle is united to the body
as its form?</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>***OBJ 6: Further, whatever exists in a thing by reason of its nature
exists in it always. But to be united to matter belongs to the form by
reason of its nature; because form is the act of matter, not by an accidental
quality, but by its own essence; otherwise matter and form would not make
a thing substantially one, but only accidentally one. Therefore a form
cannot be without its own proper matter. But the intellectual principle,
since it is incorruptible, as was shown above (Q75, A6), remains separate
from the body, after the dissolution of the body. Therefore the intellectual
principle is not united to the body as its form.

<P><B>I answer that</B>, We must assert that the intellect which is the
principle of intellectual operation is the form of the human body. For
that whereby primarily anything acts is a form of the thing to which the
act is to be attributed: for instance, that whereby a body is primarily
healed is health, and that whereby the soul knows primarily is knowledge;
hence health is a form of the body, and knowledge is a form of the soul.
The reason is because nothing acts except so far as it is in act; wherefore
a thing acts by that whereby it is in act. Now it is clear that the first
thing by which the body lives is the soul. And as life appears through
various operations in different degrees of living things, that whereby
we primarily perform each of all these vital actions is the soul. For the
soul is the primary principle of our nourishment, sensation, and local
movement; and likewise of our understanding. Therefore this principle by
which we primarily understand, whether it be called the intellect or the
intellectual soul, is the form of the body. This is the demonstration used
by Aristotle (De Anima ii, 2).
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>***** Reply OBJ 6: To be united to the body belongs to the soul by reason
of itself, as it belongs to a light body by reason of itself to be raised
up. And as a light body remains light, when removed from its proper place,
retaining meanwhile an aptitude and an inclination for its proper place;
so the human soul retains its proper existence when separated from the
body, having an aptitude and a natural inclination to be united to the
body.
