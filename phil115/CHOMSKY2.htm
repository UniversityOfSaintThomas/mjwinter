<p>It is interesting to observe the fate of the Cartesian version of the
mind-body problem and the problem of the existence of other minds. The
mind-body problem can be posed sensibly only insofar as we have a definite
conception of body. If we have no such definite and fixed conception, we
cannot ask whether some phenomena fall beyond its range. The Cartesians
offered a fairly definite conception of body in terms of their contact
mechanics, which in many respects reflects commonsense understanding. Therefore
they could sensibly formulate the mind-body problem and the problem of
other minds. There was important work attempting to develop the concept
of mind further, including studies by British Neoplatonists of the seventeenth
century that explored the categories and principles of perception and cognition
along lines that were later extended by Kant and that were rediscovered,
independently, in twentieth century Gestalt psychology.
<p>Another line of development was the "general and philosophical grammar"
(in our terms, scientific grammar) of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and
early nineteenth centuries, which was much influenced by Cartesian conceptions,
particularly in the early period. These inquiries into universal grammar
sought to lay bare the general principles of language. These were regarded
as not essentially different from the general principles of thought, so
that language is "a mirror of mind," in the conventional phrase. For various
reasons-some good, some not-these inquiries were disparaged and abandoned
for a century, to be resurrected, again independently, a generation ago,
though in quite different terms and without recourse to any dualist assumptions.
<p>It is also interesting to see how the Cartesian conception of body and
mind entered social thought, most strikingly in the libertarian ideas of
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, which were based on strictly Cartesian conceptions
of body and mind. Because humans, possessing minds, are crucially distinct
from machines (including animals), so Rousseau argued, and because the
properties of mind crucially surpass mechanical determinacy, therefore
any infringement on human freedom is illegitimate and must be confronted
and overcome. Although the later development of such thinking abandoned
the Cartesian framework, its origins lie in significant measure in these
classical ideas.
<p>The Cartesian conception of a second substance was generally abandoned
in later years, but it is important to recognize that it was not the theory
of mind that was refuted (one might argue that it was hardly dear enough
to be confirmed or refuted). Rather, the Cartesian concept of <i>body </i>was
refuted by seventeenth century physics, particularly in the work of Isaac
Newton, which laid the foundations for modem science. Newton demonstrated
that the motions of the heavenly bodies could not be explained by the principles
of Descartes' contact mechanics, so that the Cartesian concept of body
must be abandoned. In the Newtonian framework there is a "force" that one
body exerts on another, without contact between them, a kind of "action
at a distance." Whatever this force may be, it does not fall within the
Cartesian framework of contact mechanics. Newton himself found this conclusion
unsatisfying. He sometimes referred to gravitational force as "occult"
and suggested that his theory gave only a mathematical description of events
in the physical world, not a true "philosophical" (in more modem terminology,
"scientific") explanation of these events. Until the late nineteenth century
it was still widely held that a true explanation must be framed somehow
in mechanical or quasi-mechanical terms. Others, notably the chemist and
philosopher Joseph Priestley, argued that bodies themselves possess capacities
that go beyond the limits of contact mechanics, specifically the property
of attracting other bodies, but perhaps far more. Without pursuing subsequent
developments further, the general conclusion is that the Cartesian concept
of body was found to be untenable.
<p>What is the concept of body that finally emerged? The answer is that
there is no clear and definite concept of body. If the best theory of the
material world that we can construct includes a variety of forces, particles
that have no mass, and other entities that would have been offensive to
the "scientific common sense" of the Cartesians, then so be it: We conclude
that these are properties of the physical world, the world of body. The
conclusions are tentative, as befits empirical hypotheses, but are not
subject to criticism because they transcend some a priori conception of
body. There is no longer any definite conception of body. Rather, the material
world is whatever we discover it to be, with whatever properties it must
be assumed to have for the purposes of explanatory theory. Any intelligible
theory that offers genuine explanations and that can be assimilated to
the core notions of physics becomes part of the theory of the material
world, part of our account of body. If we have such a theory in some domain,
we seek to assimilate it to the core notions of physics, perhaps modifying
these notions as we carry out this enterprise. In the study of human psychology,
if we develop a theory of some cognitive faculty (the language faculty,
for example) and find that this faculty has certain properties, we seek
to discover the mechanisms of the brain that exhibit these properties and
to account for them in the terms of the physical sciences-keeping open
the possibility that the concepts of the physical sciences might have to
be modified, just as the concepts of Cartesian contact mechanics had to
be modified to account for the motion of the heavenly bodies, and as has
happened repeatedly in the evolution of the natural sciences since Newton's
day.
<p>In short, there is no definite concept of body. Rather, there is a material
world, the properties of which are to be discovered, with no a priori demarcation
of what will count as "body." The mind-body problem can therefore not even
be formulated. The problem cannot be solved, because there is no clear
way to state it. Unless someone proposes a definite concept of body, we
cannot ask whether some phenomena exceed its bounds. Similarly, we cannot
pose the problem of other minds. We can, and I think should, continue to
use mentalistic terminology, as I have done throughout in discussing mental
representations and operations that form and modify them in mental computation.
But we do not see ourselves as investigating the properties of some "second
substance," something crucially distinct from body that interacts with
body in some mysterious way, perhaps through divine intervention. Rather,
we are studying the properties of the material world at a level of abstraction
at which we believe, rightly or wrongly, that a genuine explanatory theory
can be constructed, a theory that provides genuine insight into the nature
of the phenomena that concern us. These phenomena, in fact, are of real
intellectual interest not so much in themselves but in the avenue that
they provide for us to penetrate into the deeper workings of the mind.
Ultimately, we hope to assimilate this study to the mainstream of the natural
sciences, much as the study of genes or of valence and the properties of
the chemical elements was assimilated to more fundamental sciences. We
recognize, however, that, as in the past, it may turn out that these fundamental
sciences must be modified or extended to provide foundations for the abstract
theories of complex systems, such as the human mind.
<p>Our task, then, is to discover genuine explanatory theories and to use
these discoveries to facilitate inquiry into physical mechanisms with the
properties outlined in these theories. Wherever this inquiry leads, it
will be within the domain of "body." Or more accurately, we simply abandon
the whole conception of body as possibly distinct from something else and
use the methods of rational inquiry to learn as much as we can about the
world-what we call the material world, whatever exotic properties it turns
out to have.
<p>The mind-body problem remains the subject of much controversy, debate,
and speculation, and in this regard the problem is still very much alive.
But the discussion seems to me incoherent in fundamental respects. Unlike
the Cartesians, we have no definite concept of body. It is therefore quite
unclear how we can even ask whether some phenomena lie beyond the range
of the study of body, failing within the separate study of mind.
<p>Recall the logic of Descartes's argument for the existence of a second
substance, <i>res cogitans. </i>Having defined "body" in terms of contact
mechanics, he argued that certain phenomena lie beyond its domain, so that
some new principle was required; given his metaphysics, a second substance
must be postulated. The logic is essentially sound; it is, in fact, much
like Newton's, when he demonstrated the inadequacy of Cartesian contact
mechanics for the explanation of the motion of the heavenly bodies so that
a new principle, the principle of gravitational attraction, had to be postulated.
The crucial difference between the Cartesian and the Newtonian enterprises
was that the latter offered a genuine explanatory theory of the behavior
of bodies, whereas the Cartesian theory offered no satisfactory account
of properties such as the creative aspect of language use that lie beyond
mechanical explanation in Descartes's view. Therefore Newton's conceptions
came to be the "scientific common sense" of later generations of scientists,
while Descartes's fell by the wayside.
