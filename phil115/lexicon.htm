<P>2. <B>Formal</B>- structure (actuality)</P>

<P><B>Potency/Actuality</B>- In Aristotle and St. Thomas, the soul is defined
in terms of these two concepts. The distinction between matter/form is
analogous. </P>

<P><B>Potency</B>- unfinished, indeterminate, imperfect, incomplete</P>

<P><B>Actuality</B>- finished, determinate, perfect, complete a) first
act- possession of a power (e.g. thought) b) second act- exercise of that
power (e.g. thinking about philosophy)</P>

<P><B>Substance/Accident</B>- Human beings are examples of composite substances
(see Aristotelian ontology).</P>

<P><B>Substance-</B> that which exists in itself </P>

<P><B>Accident-</B> that which exists in another (i.e. a substance)</P>

<P><B>Essential/Accidental</B> Properties-</P>

<P><B>Essential</B>- those attributes which a thing must have to be what
it is (e.g. rationality for humans) </P>

<P><B>Accidental-</B> those attributes which a thing might lack but remain
the same thing (e.g. six feet tall) </P>

<P><B>Definition of Soul-</B> first actuality of a body having life
potentially.
Soul is the formal cause of the human composite which is a substance; body
is the material cause. (God is the efficient cause; God's providential
plan is the final cause)</P>
