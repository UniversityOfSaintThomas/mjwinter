Now (after first noting what must bedone or avoided, in order to arrive at a knowledge of the truth) my principaltask is to endeavour to emerge from the state of doubt into which I havethese last days fallen, and to see whether nothing certain can be knownregarding material things. </P><P>But before examining whether any such objects as I conceive exist outsideof me, I must consider the ideas of them in so far as they are in my thought,and see which of them are distinct and which confused. </P><P>In the first place, I am able distinctly to imagine that quantity whichphilosophers commonly call continuous, or the extension in length, breadth,or depth, that is in this quantity, or rather in the object to which itis attributed. Further, I can number in it many different parts, and attributeto each of its parts many sorts of size, figure, situation and local movement,and, finally, I can assign to each of these movements all degrees of duration.</P><P>And not only do I know these things with distinctness when I considerthem in general, but, likewise [however little I apply my attention tothe matter], I discover an infinitude of particulars respecting numbers,figures, movements, and other such things, whose truth is so manifest,and so well accords with my nature, that when I begin to discover them,it seems to me that I learn nothing new, or recollect what I formerly knew-- that is to say, that I for the first time perceive things which werealready present to my mind, although I had not as yet applied my mind tothem. </P><P>And what I here find to be most important is that I discover in myselfan infinitude of ideas of certain things which cannot be esteemed as purenegations, although they may possibly have no existence outside of my thought,and which are not framed by me, although it is within my power either tothink or not to think them, but which possess natures which are true andimmutable. For example, when I imagine a triangle, although there may nowherein the world be such a figure outside my thought, or ever have been, thereis nevertheless in this figure a certain determinate nature, form, or essence,which is immutable and eternal, which I have not invented, and which inno wise depends on my mind, as appears from the fact that diverse propertiesof that triangle can be demonstrated, viz. that its three angles are equalto two right angles, that the greatest side is subtended by the greatestangle, and the like, which now, whether I wish it or do not wish it, Irecognise very clearly as pertaining to it, although I never thought ofthe matter at all when I imagined a triangle for the first time, and whichtherefore cannot be said to have been invented by me. </P><P>Nor does the objection hold good that possibly this idea of a trianglehas reached my mind through the medium of my senses, since I have sometimesseen bodies triangular in shape; because I can form in my mind an infinitudeof other figures regarding which we cannot have the least conception oftheir ever having been objects of sense, and I can nevertheless demonstratevarious properties pertaining to their nature as well as to that of thetriangle, and these must certainly all be true since I conceive them clearly.Hence they are something, and not pure negation; for it is perfectly clearthat all that is true is something, and I have already fully demonstratedthat all that I know clearly is true. And even although I had not demonstratedthis, the nature of my mind is such that I could not prevent myself fromholding them to be true so long as I conceive them clearly; and I recollectthat even when I was still strongly attached to the objects of sense, Icounted as the most certain those truths which I conceived clearly as regardsfigures, numbers, and the other matters which pertain to arithmetic andgeometry, and, in general, to pure and abstract mathematics. </P><P>But now, if just because I can draw the idea of something from my thought,it follows that all which I know clearly and distinctly as pertaining tothis object does really belong to it, may I not derive from this an argumentdemonstrating the existence of God? It is certain that I no less find theidea of God, that is to say, the idea of a supremely perfect Being, inme, than that of any figure or number whatever it is; and I do not knowany less clearly and distinctly that an [actual and] eternal existencepertains to this nature than I know that all that which I am able to demonstrateof some figure or number truly pertains to the nature of this figure ornumber, and therefore, although all that I concluded in the preceding Meditationswere found to be false, the existence of God would pass with me as at leastas certain as I have ever held the truths of mathematics (which concernonly numbers and figures) to be. </P><P>This indeed is not at first manifest, since it would seem to presentsome appearance of being a sophism. For being accustomed in all other thingsto make a distinction between existence and essence, I easily persuademyself that the existence can be separated from the essence of God, andthat we can thus conceive God as not actually existing. But, nevertheless,when I think of it with more attention, I clearly see that existence canno more be separated from the essence of God than can its having its threeangles equal to two right angles be separated from the essence of a [rectilinear]triangle, or the idea of a mountain from the idea of a valley; and so thereis not any less repugnance to our conceiving a God (that is, a Being supremelyperfect) to whom existence is lacking (that is to say, to whom a certainperfection is lacking), than to conceive of a mountain which has no valley.</P><P>But although I cannot really conceive of a God without existence anymore than a mountain without a valley, still from the fact that I conceiveof a mountain with a valley, it does not follow that there is such a mountainin the world; similarly although I conceive of God as possessing existence,it would seem that it does not follow that there is a God which exists;for my thought does not impose any necessity upon things, and just as Imay imagine a winged horse, although no horse with wings exists, so I couldperhaps attribute existence to God, although no God existed. </P><P>But a sophism is concealed in this objection; for from the fact thatI cannot conceive a mountain without a valley, it does not follow thatthere is any mountain or any valley in existence, but only that the mountainand the valley, whether they exist or do not exist, cannot in any way beseparated one from the other. While from the fact that I cannot conceiveGod without existence, it follows that existence is inseparable from Him,and hence that He really exists; not that my thought can bring this topass, or impose any necessity on things, but, on the contrary, becausethe necessity which lies in the thing itself, i.e. the necessity of theexistence of God determines me to think in this way. For it is not withinmy power to think of God without existence (that is of a supremely perfectBeing devoid of a supreme perfection) though it is in my power to imaginea horse either with wings or without wings. </P><P>And we must not here object that it is in truth necessary for me toassert that God exists after having presupposed that He possesses everysort of perfection, since existence is one of these, but that as a matterof fact my original supposition was not necessary, just as it is not necessaryto consider that all quadrilateral figures can be inscribed in the circle;for supposing I thought this, I should be constrained to admit that therhombus might be inscribed in the circle since it is a quadrilateral figure,which, however, is manifestly false. [We must not, I say, make any suchallegations because] although it is not necessary that I should at anytime entertain the notion of God, nevertheless whenever it happens thatI think of a first and a sovereign Being, and, so to speak, derive theidea of Him from the storehouse of my mind, it is necessary that I shouldattribute to Him every sort of perfection, although I do not get so faras to enumerate them all, or to apply my mind to each one in particular.And this necessity suffices to make me conclude (after having recognisedthat existence is a perfection) that this first and sovereign Being reallyexists; just as though it is not necessary for me ever to imagine any triangle,yet, whenever I wish to consider a rectilinear figure composed only ofthree angles, it is absolutely essential that I should attribute to itall those properties which serve to bring about the conclusion that itsthree angles are not greater than two right angles, even although I maynot then be considering this point in particular. But when I consider whichfigures are capable of being inscribed in the circle, it is in no wisenecessary that I should think that all quadrilateral figures are of thisnumber; on the contrary, I cannot even pretend that this is the case, solong as I do not desire to accept anything which I cannot conceive clearlyand distinctly. And in consequence there is a great difference betweenthe false suppositions such as this, and the true ideas born within me,the first and principal of which is that of God. For really I discern inmany ways that this idea is not something factitious, and depending solelyon my thought, but that it is the image of a true and immutable nature;first of all, because I cannot conceive anything but God himself to whoseessence existence [necessarily] pertains; in the second place because itis not possible for me to conceive two or more Gods in this same position;and, granted that there is one such God who now exists, I see clearly thatit is necessary that He should have existed from all eternity, and thatHe must exist eternally; and finally, because I know an infinitude of otherproperties in God, none of which I can either diminish or change. </P><P>For the rest, whatever proof or argument I avail myself of, we mustalways return to the point that it is only those things which we conceiveclearly and distinctly that have the power of persuading me entirely. Andalthough amongst the matters which I conceive of in this way, some indeedare manifestly obvious to all, while others only manifest themselves tothose who consider them closely and examine them attentively; still, afterthey have once been discovered, the latter are not esteemed as any lesscertain than the former. For example, in the case of every right-angledtriangle, although it does not so manifestly appear that the square ofthe base is equal to the squares of the two other sides as that this baseis opposite to the greatest angle; still, when this has once been apprehended,we are just as certain of its truth as of the truth of the other. And asregards God, if my mind were not pre-occupied with prejudices, and if mythought did not find itself on all hands diverted by the continual pressureof sensible things, there would be nothing which I could know more immediatelyand more easily than Him. For is there anything more manifest than thatthere is a God, that is to say, a Supreme Being, to whose essence aloneexistence pertains?21 And although for a firm grasp of this truth I haveneed of a strenuous application of mind, at present I not only feel myselfto be as assured of it as of all that I hold as most certain, but I alsoremark that the certainty of all other things depends on it so absolutely,that without this knowledge it is impossible ever to know anything perfectly.</P><P>For although I am of such a nature that as long as22 I understand anythingvery clearly and distinctly, I am naturally impelled to believe it to betrue, yet because I am also of such a nature that I cannot have my mindconstantly fixed on the same object in order to perceive it clearly, andas I often recollect having formed a past judgment without at the sametime properly recollecting the reasons that led me to make it, it may happenmeanwhile that other reasons present themselves to me, which would easilycause me to change my opinion, if I were ignorant of the facts of the existenceof God, and thus I should have no true and certain knowledge, but onlyvague and vacillating opinions. Thus, for example, when I consider thenature of a [rectilinear] triangle, I who have some little knowledge ofthe principles of geometry recognise quite clearly that the three anglesare equal to two right angles, and it is not possible for me not to believethis so long as I apply my mind to its demonstration; but so soon as Iabstain from attending to the proof, although I still recollect havingclearly comprehended it, it may easily occur that I come to doubt its truth,if I am ignorant of there being a God. For I can persuade myself of havingbeen so constituted by nature that I can easily deceive myself even inthose matters which I believe myself to apprehend with the greatest evidenceand certainty, especially when I recollect that I have frequently judgedmatters to be true and certain which other reasons have afterwards impelledme to judge to be altogether false. </P><P>But after I have recognised that there is a God -- because at the sametime I have also recognised that all things depend upon Him, and that Heis not a deceiver, and from that have inferred that what I perceive clearlyand distinctly cannot fail to be true -- although I no longer pay attentionto the reasons for which I have judged this to be true, provided that Irecollect having clearly and distinctly perceived it no contrary reasoncan be brought forward which could ever cause me to doubt of its truth;and thus I have a true and certain knowledge of it. And this same knowledgeextends likewise to all other things which I recollect having formerlydemonstrated, such as the truths of geometry and the like; for what canbe alleged against them to cause me to place them in doubt? Will it besaid that my nature is such as to cause me to be frequently deceived? ButI already know that I cannot be deceived in the judgment whose groundsI know clearly. Will it be said that I formerly held many things to betrue and certain which I have afterwards recognised to be false? But Ihad not had any clear and distinct knowledge of these things, and not asyet knowing the rule whereby I assure myself of the truth, I had been impelledto give my assent from reasons which I have since recognised to be lessstrong than I had at the time imagined them to be. What further objectioncan then be raised? That possibly I am dreaming (an objection I myselfmade a little while ago), or that all the thoughts which I now have areno more true than the phantasies of my dreams? But even though I sleptthe case would be the same, for all that is clearly present to my mindis absolutely true. </P><P>And so I very clearly recognise that the certainty and truth of allknowledge depends alone on the knowledge of the true God, in so much that,before I knew Him, I could not have a perfect knowledge of any other thing.And now that I know Him I have the means of acquiring a perfect knowledgeof an infinitude of things, not only of those which relate to God Himselfand other intellectual matters, but also of those which pertain to corporealnature in so far as it is the object of pure mathematics [which have noconcern with whether it exists or not]. </P><B></B><B></B><P><B>Meditation VI: Of the Existence of Material Things, and of the realdistinction between the Soul and Body of Man </B></P><P>Nothing further now remains but to inquire whether material things exist.And certainly I at least know that these may exist in so far as they areconsidered as the objects of pure mathematics, since in this aspect I perceivethem clearly and distinctly. For there is no doubt that God possesses thepower to produce everything that I am capable of perceiving with distinctness,and I have never deemed that anything was impossible for Him, unless Ifound a contradiction in attempting to conceive it clearly. Further, thefaculty of imagination which I possess, and of which, experience tellsme, I make use when I apply myself to the consideration of material things,is capable of persuading me of their existence; for when I attentivelyconsider what imagination is, I find that it is nothing but a certain applicationof the faculty of knowledge to the body which is immediately present toit, and which therefore exists. </P><P>And to render this quite clear, I remark in the first place the differencethat exists between the imagination and pure intellection [or conception23]. For example, when I imagine a triangle, I do not conceive it only asa figure comprehended by three lines, but I also apprehend24 these threelines as present by the power and inward vision of my mind,25 and thisis what I call imagining. But if I desire to think of a chiliagon, I certainlyconceive truly that it is a figure composed of a thousand sides, just aseasily as I conceive of a triangle that it is a figure of three sides only;but I cannot in any way imagine the thousand sides of a chiliagon [as Ido the three sides of a triangle], nor do I, so to speak, regard them aspresent [with the eyes of my mind]. And although in accordance with thehabit I have formed of always employing the aid of my imagination whenI think of corporeal things, it may happen that in imagining a chiliagonI confusedly represent to myself some figure, yet it is very evident thatthis figure is not a chiliagon, since it in no way differs from that whichI represent to myself when I think of a myriagon or any other many-sidedfigure; nor does it serve my purpose in discovering the properties whichgo to form the distinction between a chiliagon and other polygons. Butif the question turns upon a pentagon, it is quite true that I can conceiveits figure as well as that of a chiliagon without the help of my imagination;but I can also imagine it by applying the attention of my mind to eachof its five sides, and at the same time to the space which they enclose.And thus I clearly recognise that I have need of a particular effort ofmind in order to effect the act of imagination, such as I do not requirein order to understand, and this particular effort of mind clearly manifeststhe difference which exists between imagination and pure intellection.26I remark besides that this power of imagination which is in one, inasmuchas it differs from the power of understanding, is in no wise a necessaryelement in my nature, or in [my essence, that is to say, in] the essenceof my mind; for although I did not possess it I should doubtless ever remainthe same as I now am, from which it appears that we might conclude thatit depends on something which differs from me. And I easily conceive thatif some body exists with which my mind is conjoined and united in sucha way that it can apply itself to consider it when it pleases, it may bethat by this means it can imagine corporeal objects; so that this modeof thinking differs from pure intellection only inasmuch as mind in itsintellectual activity in some manner turns on itself, and considers someof the ideas which it possesses in itself; while in imagining it turnstowards the body, and there beholds in it something conformable to theidea which it has either conceived of itself or perceived by the senses.I easily understand, I say, that the imagination could be thus constitutedif it is true that body exists; and because I can discover no other convenientmode of explaining it, I conjecture with probability that body does exist;but this is only with probability, and although I examine all things withcare, I nevertheless do not find that from this distinct idea of corporealnature, which I have in my imagination, I can derive any argument fromwhich there will necessarily be deduced the existence of body. </P><P>But I am in the habit of imagining many other things besides this corporealnature which is the object of pure mathematics, to wit, the colours, sounds,scents, pain, and other such things, although less distinctly. And inasmuchas I perceive these things much better through the senses, by the mediumof which, and by the memory, they seem to have reached my imagination,I believe that, in order to examine them more conveniently, it is rightthat I should at the same time investigate the nature of sense perception,and that I should see if from the ideas which I apprehend by this modeof thought, which I call feeling, I cannot derive some certain proof ofthe existence of corporeal objects. </P><P>And first of all I shall recall to my memory those matters which I hithertoheld to be true, as having perceived them through the senses, and the foundationson which my belief has rested; in the next place I shall examine the reasonswhich have since obliged me to place them in doubt; in the last place Ishall consider which of them I must now believe. </P><P>First of all, then, I perceived that I had a head, hands, feet, andall other members of which this body -- which I considered as a part, orpossibly even as the whole, of myself -- is composed. Further I was sensiblethat this body was placed amidst many others, from which it was capableof being affected in many different ways, beneficial and hurtful, and Iremarked that a certain feeling of pleasure accompanied those that werebeneficial, and pain those which were harmful. And in addition to thispleasure and pain, I also experienced hunger, thirst, and other similarappetites, as also certain corporeal inclinations towards joy, sadness,anger, and other similar passions. And outside myself, in addition to extension,figure, and motions of bodies, I remarked in them hardness, heat, and allother tactice qualities, and, further, light and colour, and scents andsounds, the variety of which gave me the means of distinguishing the sky,the earth, the sea, and generally all the other bodies, one from the other.And certainly, considering the ideas of all these qualities which presentedthemselves to my mind, and which alone I perceived properly or immediately,it was not without reason that I believed myself to perceive objects quitedifferent from my thought, to wit, bodies from which those ideas proceeded;for I found by experience that these ideas presented themselves to me withoutmy consent being requisite, so that I could not perceive any object, howeverdesirous I might be, unless it were present to the organs of sense; andit was not in my power not to perceive it, when it was present. And becausethe ideas which I received through the senses were much more lively, moreclear, and even, in their own way, more distinct than any of those whichI could of myself frame in meditation, or than those I found impressedon my memory, it appeared as though they could not have proceeded frommy mind, so that they must necessarily have been produced in me by someother things. And having no knowledge of those objects excepting the knowledgewhich the ideas themselves gave me, nothing was more likely to occur tomy mind than that the objects were similar to the ideas which were caused.And because I likewise remembered that I had formerly made use of my sensesrather than my reason, and recognised that the ideas which I formed ofmyself were not so distinct as those which I perceived through the senses,and that they were most frequently even composed of portions of these last,I persuaded myself easily that I had no idea in my mind which had not formerlycome to me through the senses. Nor was it without some reason that I believedthat this body (which be a certain special right I call my own) belongedto me more properly and more strictly than any other; for in fact I couldnever be separated from it as from other bodies; I experienced in it andon account of it all my appetites and affections, and finally I was touchedby the feeling of pain and the titillation of pleasure in its parts, andnot in the parts of other bodies which were separated from it. But whenI inquired, why, from some, I know not what, painful sensation, there followssadness of mind, and from the pleasurable sensation there arises joy, orwhy this mysterious pinching of the stomach which I call hunger causesme to desire to eat, and dryness of throat causes a desire to drink, andso on, I could give no reason excepting that nature taught me so; for thereis certainly no affinity (that I at least can understand) between the cravingof the stomach and the desire to eat, any more than between the perceptionof whatever causes pain and the thought of sadness which arises from thisperception. And in the same way it appeared to me that I had learned fromnature all the other judgments which I formed regarding the objects ofmy senses, since I remarked that these judgments were formed in me beforeI had the leisure to weigh and consider any reasons which might obligeme to make them. </P><P>But afterwards many experiences little by little destroyed all the faithwhich I had rested in my senses; for I from time to time observed thatthose towers which from afar appeared to me to be round, more closely observedseemed square, and that colossal statues raised on the summit of thesetowers, appeared as quite tiny statues when viewed from the bottom; andso in an infinitude of other cases I found error in judgments founded onthe external senses. And not only in those founded on the external senses,but even in those founded on the internal as well; for is there anythingmore intimate or more internal than pain? And yet I have learned from somepersons whose arms or legs have been cut off, that they sometimes seemedto feel pain in the part which had been amputated, which made me thinkthat I could not be quite certain that it was a certain member which painedme, even although I felt pain in it. And to those grounds of doubt I havelately added two others, which are very general; the first is that I neverhave believed myself to feel anything in waking moments which I cannotalso sometimes believe myself to feel when I sleep, and as I do not thinkthat these things which I seem to feel in sleep, proceed from objects outsideof me, I do not see any reason why I should have this belief regardingobjects which I seem to perceive while awake. The other was that beingstill ignorant, or rather supposing myself to be ignorant, of the authorof my being, I saw nothing to prevent me from having been so constitutedby nature that I might be deceived even in matters which seemed to me tobe most certain. And as to the grounds on which I was formerly persuadedof the truth of sensible objects, I had not much trouble in replying tothem. For since nature seemed to cause me to lean towards many things fromwhich reason repelled me, I did not believe that I should trust much tothe teachings of nature. And although the ideas which I receive by thesenses do not depend on my will, I did not think that one should for thatreason conclude that they proceeded from things different from myself,since possibly some faculty might be discovered in me -- though hithertounknown to me -- which produced them. </P><P>But now that I begin to know myself better, and to discover more clearlythe author of my being, I do not in truth think that I should rashly admitall the matters which the senses seem to teach us, but, on the other hand,I do not think that I should doubt them all universally. </P><P>And first of all, because I know that all things which I apprehend clearlyand distinctly can be created by God as I apprehend them, it suffices thatI am able to apprehend one thing apart from another clearly and distinctlyin order to be certain that the one is different from the other, sincethey may be made to exist in separation at least by the omnipotence ofGod; and it does not signify by what power this separation is made in orderto compel me to judge them to be different: and, therefore, just becauseI know certainly that I exist, and that meanwhile I do not remark thatany other thing necessarily pertains to my nature or essence, exceptingthat I am a thinking thing, I rightly conclude that my essence consistssolely in the fact that I am a thinking thin [or a substance whose wholeessence or nature is to think]. And although possibly (or rather certainly,as I shall say in a moment) I possess a body with which I am very intimatelyconjoined, yet because, on the one side, I have a clear and distinct ideaof myself inasmuch as I am only a thinking and unextended thing, and as,on the other, I possess a distinct idea of body, inasmuch as it is onlyan extended and unthinking thing, it is certain that this I [that is tosay, my soul by which I am what I am], is entirely and absolutely distinctfrom my body, and can exist without it. </P><P>I further find in myself faculties imploying modes of thinking peculiarto themselves, to wit, the faculties of imagination and feeling, withoutwhich I can easily conceive myself clearly and distinctly as a completebeing; while, on the other hand, they cannot be so conceived apart fromme, that is without an intelligent substance in which they reside, for[in the notion we have of these faculties, or, to use the language of theSchools] in their formal concept, some kind of intellection is comprised,from which I infer that they are distinct from me as its modes are froma thing. I observe also in me some other faculties such as that of changeof position, the assumption of different figures and such like, which cannotbe conceived, any more than can the preceding, apart from some substanceto which they are attached, and consequently cannot exist without it; butit is very clear that these faculties, if it be true that they exist, mustbe attached to some corporeal or extended substance, and not to an intelligentsubstance, since in the clear and distinct conception of these there issome sort of extension found to be present, but no intellection at all.There is certainly further in me a certain passive faculty of perception,that is, of receiving and recognising the ideas of sensible things, butthis would be useless to me [and I could in no way avail myself of it],if there were not either in me or in some other thing another active facultycapable of forming and producing these ideas. But this active faculty cannotexist in me [inasmuch as I am a thing that thinks] seeing that it doesnot presuppose thought, and also that those ideas are often produced inme without my contributing in any way to the same, and often even againstmy will; it is thus necessarily the case that the faculty resides in somesubstance different from me in which all the reality which is objectivelyin the ideas that are produced by this faculty is formally or eminentlycontained, as I remarked before. And this substance is either a body, thatis, a corporeal nature in which there is contained formally [and really]all that which is objectively [and by representation] in those ideas, orit is God Himself, or some other creature more noble than body in whichthat same is contained eminently. But, since God is no deceiver, it isvery manifest that He does not communicate to me these ideas immediatelyand by Himself, nor yet by the intervention of some creature in which theirreality is not formally, but only eminently, contained. For since He hasgiven me no faculty to recognise that this is the case, but, on the otherhand, a very great inclination to believe [that they are sent to me or]that they are conveyed to me by corporeal objects, I do not see how Hecould be defended from the accusation of deceit if these ideas were producedby causes other than corporeal objects. Hence we must allow that corporealthings exist. However, they are perhaps not exactly what we perceive bythe senses, since this comprehension by the senses is in many instancesvery obscure and confused; but we must at least admit that all things whichI conceive in them clearly and distinctly, that is to say, all things which,speaking generally, are comprehended in the object of pure mathematics,are truly to be recognised as external objects. </P><P>As to other things, however, which are either particular only, as, forexample, that the sun is of such and such a figure, etc., or which areless clearly and distinctly conceived, such as light, sound, pain and thelike, it is certain that although they are very dubious and uncertain,yet on the sole ground that God is not a deceiver, and that consequentlyHe has not permitted any falsity to exist in my opinion which He has notlikewise given me the faculty of correcting, I may assuredly hope to concludethat I have within me the means of arriving at the truth even here. Andfirst of all there is no doubt that in all things which nature teachesme there is some truth contained; for by nature, considered in general,I now understand no other thing than either God Himself or else the orderand disposition which God has established in created things; and by mynature in particular I understand no other thing than the complexus ofall the things which God has given me. </P><P>But there is nothing which this nature teaches me more expressly [normore sensibly] than that I have a body which is adversely affected whenI feel pain, which has need of food or drink when I experience the feelingsof hunger and thirst, and so on; nor can I doubt there being some truthin all this. </P><P>Nature also teaches me by these sensations of pain, hunger, thirst,etc., that I am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a vessel, butthat I am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a vessel, but that Iam very closely united to it, and so to speak so intermingled with it thatI seem to compose with it one whole. For if that were not the case, whenmy body is hurt, I, who am merely a thinking thing, should not feel pain,for I should perceive this wound by the understanding only, just as thesailor perceives by sight when something is damaged in his vessel; andwhen my body has need of drink or food, I should clearly understand thefact without being warned of it by confused feelings of hunger and thirst.For all these sensations of hunger, thirst, pain, etc. are in truth noneother than certain confused modes of thought which are produced by theunion and apparent intermingling of mind and body. </P><P>Moreover, nature teaches me that many other bodies exist around mine,of which some are to be avoided, and others sought after. And certainlyfrom the fact that I am sensible of different sorts of colours, sounds,scents, tastes, heat, hardness, etc., I very easily conclude that thereare in the bodies from which all these diverse sense-perceptions proceedcertain variations which answer to them, although possibly these are notreally at all similar to them. And also from the fact that amongst thesedifferent sense-perceptions some are very agreeable to me and others disagreeable,it is quite certain that my body (or rather myself in my entirety, inasmuchas I am formed of body and soul) may receive different impressions agreeableand disagreeable from the other bodies which surround it. </P><P>But there are many other things which nature seems to have taught me,but which at the same time I have never really received from her, but whichhave been brought about in my mind by a certain habit which I have of forminginconsiderate judgments on things; and thus it may easily happen that thesejudgments contain some error. Take, for example, the opinion which I holdthat all space in which there is nothing that affects [or makes an impressionon] my senses is void; that in a body which is warm there is somethingentirely similar to the idea of heat which is in me; that in a white orgreen body there is the same whiteness or greenness that I perceive; thatin a bitter or sweet body there is the same taste, and so on in other instances;that the stars, the towers, and all other distant bodies are of the samefigure and size as they appear from far off to our eyes, etc. But in orderthat in this there should be nothing which I do not conceive distinctly,I should define exactly what I really understand when I say that I am taughtsomewhat by nature. For here I take nature in a more limited significationthan when I term it the sum of all the things given me by God, since inthis sum many things are comprehended which only pertain to mind (and tothese I do not refer in speaking of nature) such as the notion which Ihave of the fact that what has once been done cannot ever be undone andan infinitude of such things which I know by the light of nature [withoutthe help of the body]; and seeing that it comprehends many other mattersbesides which only pertain to body, and are no longer here contained underthe name of nature, such as the quality of weight which it possesses andthe like, with which I also do not deal; for in talking of nature I onlytreat of those things given by God to me as a being composed of mind andbody. But the nature here described truly teaches me to flee from thingswhich cause the sensation of pain, and seek after the things which communicateto me the sentiment of pleasure and so forth; but I do not see that beyondthis it teaches me that from those diverse sense-perceptions we shouldever form any conclusion regarding things outside of us, without having[carefully and maturely] mentally examined them beforehand. For it seemsto me that it is mind alone, and not mind and body in conjunction, thatis requisite to a knowledge of the truth in regard to such things. Thus,although a star makes no larger an impression on my eye than the flameof a little candle there is yet in me no real or positive propensity impellingme to believe that it is not greater than that flame; but I have judgedit to be so from my earliest years, without any rational foundation. Andalthough in approaching fire I feel heat, and in approaching it a littletoo near I even feel pain, there is at the same time no reason in thiswhich could persuade me that there is in the fire something resemblingthis heat any more than there is in it something resembling the pain; allthat I have any reason to believe from this is, that there is somethingin it, whatever it may be, which excites in me these sensations of heator of pain. So also, although there are spaces in which I find nothingwhich excites my senses, I must not from that conclude that these spacescontain no body; for I see in this, as in other similar things, that Ihave been in the habit of perverting the order of nature, because theseperceptions of sense having bee placed within me by nature merely for thepurpose of signifying to my mind what things are beneficial or hurtfulto the composite whole of which it forms a part, and being up to that pointsufficiently clear and distinct, I yet avail myself of them as though theywere absolute rules by which I might immediately determine the essenceof the bodies which are outside me, as to which, in fact, they can teachme nothing but what is most obscure and confused. </P><P>But I have already sufficiently considered how, notwithstanding thesupreme goodness of God, falsity enters into the judgments I make. Onlyhere a new difficulty is presented -- one respecting those things the pursuitor avoidance of which is taught me by nature, and also respecting the internalsensations which I possess, and in which I seem to have sometimes detectederror [and thus to be directly deceived by my own nature]. To take an example,the agreeable taste of some food in which poison has been intermingledmay induce me to partake of the poison, and thus deceive me. It is true,at the same time, that in this case nature may be excused, for it onlyinduces me to desire food in which I find a pleasant taste, and not todesire the poison which is unknown to it; and thus I can infer nothingfrom this fact, except that my nature is not omniscient, at which thereis certainly no reason to be astonished, since man, being finite in nature,can only have knowledge the perfectness of which is limited. </P><P>But we not unfrequently deceive ourselves even in those things to whichwe are directly impelled by nature, as happens with those who when theyare sick desire to drink or eat things hurtful to them. It will perhapsbe said here that the cause of their deceptiveness is that their natureis corrupt, but that does not remove the difficulty, because a sick manis none the less truly God's creature than he who is in health; and itis therefore as repugnant to God's goodness for the one to have a deceitfulnature as it is for the other. And as a clock composed of wheels and counter-weightsno less exactly observes the laws of nature when it is badly made, anddoes not show the time properly, than when it entirely satisfies the wishesof its maker, and as, if I consider the body of a man as being a sort ofmachine so built up and composed of nerves, muscles, veins, blood and skin,that though there were no mind in it at all, it would not cease to havethe same motions as at present, exception being made of those movementswhich are due to the direction of the will, and in consequence depend uponthe mind [as apposed to those which operate by the disposition of its organs],I easily recognise that it would be as natural to this body, supposingit to be, for example, dropsical, to suffer the parchedness of the throatwhich usually signifies to the mind the feeling of thirst, and to be disposedby this parched feeling to move the nerves and other parts in the way requisitefor drinking, and thus to augment its malady and do harm to itself, asit is natural to it, when it has no indisposition, to be impelled to drinkfor its good by a similar cause. And although, considering the use to whichthe clock has been destined by its maker, I may say that it deflects fromthe order of its nature when it does not indicate the hours correctly;and as, in the same way, considering the machine of the human body as havingbeen formed by God in order to have in itself all the movements usuallymanifested there, I have reason for thinking that it does not follow theorder of nature when, if the throat is dry, drinking does harm to the conservationof health, nevertheless I recognise at the same time that this last modeof explaining nature is very different from the other. For this is buta purely verbal characterisation depending entirely on my thought, whichcompares a sick man and a badly constructed clock with the idea which Ihave of a healthy man and a well made clock, and it is hence extrinsicto the things to which it is applied; but according to the other interpretationof the term nature I understand something which is truly found in thingsand which is therefore not without some truth. </P><P>But certainly although in regard to the dropsical body it is only soto speak to apply an extrinsic term when we say that its nature is corrupted,inasmuch as apart from the need to drink, the throat is parched; yet inregard to the composite whole, that is to say, to the mind or soul unitedto this body, it is not a purely verbal predicate, but a real error ofnature, for it to have thirst when drinking would be hurtful to it. Andthus it still remains to inquire how the goodness of God does not preventthe nature of man so regarded from being fallacious. </P><P>In order to begin this examination, then, I here say, in the first place,that there is a great difference between mind and body, inasmuch as bodyis by nature always divisible, and the mind is entirely indivisible. For,as a matter of fact, when I consider the mind, that is to say, myself inasmuchas I am only a thinking thing, I cannot distinguish in myself any parts,but apprehend myself to be clearly one and entire; and although the wholemind seems to be united to the whole body, yet if a foot, or an arm, orsome other part, is separated from my body, I am aware that nothing hasbeen taken away from my mind. And the faculties of willing, feeling, conceiving,etc. cannot be properly speaking said to be its parts, for it is one andthe same mind which employs itself in willing and in feeling and understanding.But it is quite otherwise with corporeal or extended objects, for thereis not one of these imaginable by me which my mind cannot easily divideinto parts, and which consequently I do not recognise as being divisible;this would be sufficient to teach me that the mind or soul of man is entirelydifferent from the body, if I had not already learned it from other sources.</P><P>I further notice that the mind does not receive the impressions fromall parts of the body immediately, but only from the brain, or perhapseven from one of its smallest parts, to wit, from that in which the commonsense27 is said to reside, which, whenever it is disposed in the same particularway, conveys the same thing to the mind, although meanwhile the other portionsof the body may be differently disposed, as is testified by innumerableexperiments which it is unnecessary here to recount. I notice, also, thatthe nature of body is such that none of its parts can be moved by anotherpart a little way off which cannot also be moved in the same way by eachone of the parts which are between the two, although this more remote partdoes not act at all. As, for example, in the cord ABCD [which is in tension]if we pull the last part D, the first part A will not be moved in any waydifferently from what would be the case if one of the intervening partsB or C were pulled, and the last part D were to remain unmoved. And inthe same way, when I feel pain in my foot, my knowledge of physics teachesme that this sensation is communicated by means of nerves dispersed throughthe foot, which, being extended like cords from there to the brain, whenthey are contracted in the foot, at the same time contract the inmost portionsof the brain which is their extremity and place of origin, and then excitea certain movement which nature has established in order to cause the mindto be affected by a sensation of pain represented as existing in the foot.But because these nerves must pass through the tibia, the thigh, the loins,the back and the neck, in order to reach from the leg to the brain, itmay happen that although their extremities which are in the foot are notaffected, but only certain ones of their intervening parts [which passby the loins or the neck], this action will excite the same movement inthe brain that might have been excited there by a hurt received in thefoot, in consequence of which the mind will necessarily feel in the footthe same pain as if it had received a hurt. And the same holds good ofall the other perceptions of our senses. </P><P>I notice finally that since each of the movements which are in the portionof the brain by which the mind is immediately affected brings about oneparticular sensation only, we cannot under the circumstances imagine anythingmore likely than that this movement, amongst all the sensations which itis capable of impressing on it, causes mind to be affected by that onewhich is best fitted and most generally useful for the conservation ofthe human body when it is in health. But experience makes us aware thatall the feelings with which nature inspires us are such as I have justspoken of; and there is therefore nothing in them which does not give testimonyto the power and goodness of the God [who has produced them28 ]. Thus,for example, when the nerves which are in the feet are violently or morethan usually moved, their movement, passing through the medulla of thespine29 to the inmost parts of the brain, gives a sign to the mind whichmakes it feel somewhat, to wit, pain, as though in the foot, by which themind is excited to do its utmost to remove the cause of the evil as dangerousand hurtful to the foot. It is true that God could have constituted thenature of man in such a way that this same movement in the brain wouldhave conveyed something quite different to the mind; for example, it mighthave produced consciousness of itself either in so far as it is in thebrain, or as it is in the foot, or as it is in some other place betweenthe foot and the brain, or it might finally have produced consciousnessof anything else whatsoever; but none of all this would have contributedso well to the conservation of the body. Similarly, when we desire to drink,a certain dryness of the throat is produced which moves its nerves, andby their means the internal portions of the brain; and this movement causesin the mind the sensation of thirst, because in this case there is nothingmore useful to us than to become aware that we have need to drink for theconservation o our health; and the same holds good in other instances.</P><P>From this it is quite clear that, notwithstanding the supreme goodnessof God, the nature of man, inasmuch as it is composed of mind and body,cannot be otherwise than sometimes a source of deception. For if thereis any cause which excites, not in the foot but in some part of the nerveswhich are extended between the foot and the brain, or even in the brainitself, the same movement which usually is produced when the foot is detrimentallyaffected, pain will be experienced as though it were in the foot, and thesense will thus naturally be deceived; for since the same movement in thebrain is capable of causing but one sensation in the mind, and this sensationis much more frequently excited by a cause which hurts the foot than byanother existing in some other quarter, it is reasonable that it shouldconvey to the mind pain in the foot rather than in any other part of thebody. And although the parchedness of the throat does not always proceed,as it usually does, from the fact that drinking is necessary for the healthof the body, but sometimes comes from quite a different cause, as is thecase with dropsical patients, it is yet much better that it should misleadon this occasion than if, on the other hand, it were always to deceiveus when the body is in good health; and so on in similar cases. </P><P>And certainly this consideration is of great service to me, not onlyin enabling me to recognise all the errors to which my nature is subject,but also in enabling me to avoid them or to correct them more easily. forknowing that all my senses more frequently indicate to me truth than falsehoodrespecting the things which concern that which is beneficial to the body,and being able almost always to avail myself of many of them in order toexamine one particular thing, and, besides that, being able to make useof my memory in order to connect the present with the past, and of my understandingwhich already has discovered all the causes of my errors, I ought no longerto fear that falsity may be found in matters every day presented to meby my senses. And I ought to set aside all the doubts of these past daysas hyperbolical and ridiculous, particularly that very common uncertaintyrespecting sleep, which I could not distinguish from the waking state;for at present I find a very notable difference between the two, inasmuchas our memory can never connect our dreams one with the other, or withthe whole course of our lives, as it unites events which happen to us whilewe are awake. And, as a matter of fact, if someone, while I was awake,quite suddenly appeared to me and disappeared as fast as do the imageswhich I see in sleep, so that I could not know from whence the form camenor whither it went, it would not be without reason that I should deemit a spectre or a phantom formed by my brain [and similar to those whichI form in sleep], rather than a real man. But when I perceive things asto which I know distinctly both the place from which they proceed, andthat in which they are, and the time at which they appeared to me; andwhen, without any interruption, I can connect the perceptions which I haveof them with the whole course of my life, I am perfectly assured that theseperceptions occur while I am waking and not during sleep. And I ought inno wise to doubt the truth of such matters, if, after having called upall my senses, my memory, and my understanding, to examine them, nothingis brought to evidence by any one of them which is repugnant to what isset forth by the others. For because God is in no wise a deceiver, it followsthat I am not deceived in this. But because the exigencies of action oftenoblige us to make up our minds before having leisure to examine matterscarefully, we must confess that the life of man is very frequently subjectto error in respect to individual objects, and we must in the end acknowledgethe infirmity of our nature. </P><P>Notes </P><P>1 Copyright: 1996, James Fieser (jfieser@utm.edu), all rights reserved.Unaltered copies of this computer text file may be freely distribute forpersonal and classroom use.
