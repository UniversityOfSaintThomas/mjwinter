<P>It might be helpful to try to understand hylomorphism as an attempt
to integrate the strengths of
<BR>materialism and dualism into a distinctive position that leaves behind
the major shortcomings of
<BR>materialism and dualism.

<P>What are the strengths and shortcomings of dualism and materialism?

<P>The dualism of Plato and Descartes has the strength of leaving room
for an immaterial soul.
<BR>(Remember that Chalmers offers a version of dualism without a soul.)
An immaterial soul can
<BR>possibly explain free will. Also, the possibility of life after death
is open for dualism-- this is a
<BR>possibility required by many major religions. The major shortcoming
of dualism is that it forces us to
<BR>give up the idea that a human is just one thing. Remember, dualism
holds that we are really two
<BR>distinct and incompatible things-- material and immaterial. The incompatibility
of these two elements
<BR>is emphasized in Plato and in Descartes. But it just seems right to
think that the body is really
<BR>essential to our constitution and that we are one.

<P>Materialism has the strength of explaining how it is that we are one.
Since we are entirely physical
<BR>along with everything else in the world, there is no need to say that
there is a non-physical
<BR>component of human nature that we do not observe. Materialism fits
very well with physical science.
<BR>It also offers an excellent account of the structures and functions
of human operations. The key
<BR>shortcoming of materialism is that it does not offer an explanation
of the most interesting and
<BR>distinctive features of our mental life. Consciousness, thought, intentionality,
and other mental events
<BR>are left unexplained by materialism. (This was Chalmers' point about
an explanatory gap.) But since these phenomena are precisely what we set
out to explain, materialism falls short in a serious way.

<P>Hylomorphism is a position that was first proposed by Aristotle, but
is developed in the writings of
<BR>St. Thomas Aquinas. This view offers matter and form as two explanatory
principles of all physical
<BR>things. All physical things have matter and form, but only some physical
things have the kind of form
<BR>that sustains living activity-- this type of form is called a soul.
The more complex the living activity a thing displays, the more complex
the form (soul) supporting the activity. Since humans display the most
complex living activity in our world, humans have the most sophisticated
type of form. The most distinctive activities of our form are thinking
and choosing. The name assigned to our kind of form is "rational soul".
By this view, a human is one thing in the same way that anything with matter
and form can be one thing; just as a clay cup is one thing, so are we.
Matter and form are separate explanatory principles, but having matter
and from does not entail that a thing is not one. Even atoms, the basic
building blocks of all physical things, have matter and form. Matter cannot
exist without some kind of form.&nbsp; Contrary to dualism hylomorphism
holds that matter and form complement one another.&nbsp; Certain kinds
of matter are suited to be with certain kinds of form.

<P>Hylomorphism dictates that humans have a soul, but that our soul belongs
with our body. It is only
<BR>when the two are together that it is possible to have a human being.
Aquinas' commitment to this
<BR>point is so strong that he argues that even in the afterlife we will
be physical beings. Dualism would seem to imply that only disembodied spirits
would persist after death.

<P>Another way to distinguish among these views is to consider the relationship
between the human
<BR>brain and human thought. Materialism says that the brain is necessary
and sufficient for human
<BR>thought. Dualism says that the brain is neither necessary nor sufficient
for human thought.
<BR>Hylomorphism say that the brain is necessary but not sufficient for
human thought.
