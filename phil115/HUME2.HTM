<P>from<I> Essays on Suicide and the Immortality of the Soul</I>

<P><B>ESSAY II. ON THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL.</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I. METAPHYSICAL topics suppose that the soul
is immaterial, and that 'tis impossible for thought to belong to a material
substance. --&nbsp; But just metaphysics teach us that the notion of substance
is wholly confused and imperfect, and that we have no other idea of any
substance, than as an aggregate of particular qualities, inhering in an
unknown something. Matter, therefore, and spirit, are at bottom equally
unknown, and we cannot determine what qualities inhere in the one or in
the other. They likewise teach us that nothing can be decided a priori
concerning any cause or effect, and that experience being the only source
of our judgements of this nature, we cannot know from any other principle,
whether matter, by its structure or arrangement, may not be the cause of
thought. Abstract reasonings cannot decide any question of fact or existence.
-- But admitting a spiritual substance to be dispersed throughout the universe,
like the etherial fire of the Stoics, and to be the only inherent subject
of thought, we have reason to conclude {25} from analogy that nature uses
it after the manner she does the other substance, matter. She employs it
as a kind of paste or clay;
<BR>modifies it into a variety of forms and existences; dissolves after
a time each modification,
<BR>and from its substance erects a new form. As the same material substance
may successively compose the bodies of all animals, the same spiritual
substance may compose their minds: Their consciousness, or that system
of thought which they formed during life, may be continually dissolved
by death. And nothing interests them in the new modification.&nbsp; The
most positive asserters of the mortality of the soul, never denied the
immortality of its substance. And that an immaterial substance, as well
as a material, may lose its memory or consciousness, appears in part from
experience, if the soul be immaterial. -- Reasoning from the common course
of nature, and without supposing any new interposition of the supreme cause,
which ought always to be excluded from philosophy, {26} what is incorruptible
must also be ingenerable. The Soul therefore if immortal, existed before
our birth; and if the former existence no ways concerned us, neither will
the latter. -- Animals undoubtedly feel, think, love, hate, will, and even
reason, tho' in a more imperfect manner than men; are their souls also
immaterial and immortal?
