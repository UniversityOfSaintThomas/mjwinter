<P>We observe the world to find that some things are living while others
are not. Since every effect must have some cause, the philosopher is forced
to explain living activity. Aristotle suggests that we call the principle
or cause of life the soul. There is nothing mysterious or spooky about
this. We must account for our experiences and observations somehow.
(observations
gives rise to Aristotelian ontology)</P>

<P>Soul and body together form one hylomorphic composite. Soul and body
are two intrinsic principles of the living composite. The living composite
is a substance in the most true sense.</P>

<P>The operations of a thing follow the mode of its being. The truth of
this principle allows us to come to understand the nature of living things
by carefully observing their operations or activities. Also, from the observed
fact that certain substances have life, this principle allows us to hold
that those substances must have a mode of being by which they live. This
mode of being we call actuality or soul.</P>

<P>Having a rational soul is an essential property for humans; if they
did not have one, they would not be humans.</P>

<P>Body of a human being is not an accident (contrary to dualism). The
body and soul are intimately connected. Their union gives rise to the
hylomorphic
composite. Body and soul are two compatible principles.</P>

<P>Only that which subsists can have a per se operation. &quot;Per se&quot;
is Latin for &quot;through itself&quot;. To say that something has a per
se operation is to say that it has the capacity to perform some activity
in virtue of itself-- the exercise of such an operation does not depend
on anything else. </P>

<P>Nothing acts except insofar as it is in act; everything requires actuality
for movement. If the thing moved lacks actuality to move, then the actuality
must come form some other thing which has it (like an efficient cause).
</P>

<P>This view is called hylomorphism. It is somewhat complicated, but worth
looking at seriously. As we will see, this position begins with Aristotle's
definition of the soul. Ultimately, hylomorphism is only as plausible as
is this definition. Hylomorphism is able to explain many of the basic
intuitions
which we should be unwilling to abandon. How well does it fit with the
other criteria we have discussed?</P>
