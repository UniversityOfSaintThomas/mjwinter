<p><b><font color="#000099"><font size=+2>Course Procedure</font></font></b>
<p>Although this course is being offered completely over the Internet,
I am setting the same standards that apply to any of the courses I offer
at UST.&nbsp; Because it is easier to fall behind without regular class
meetings, it is especially important that you pay careful attention to
the deadlines that are set for all course work.&nbsp; I will try to provide
ample time for completion of all assignments.&nbsp; I will use our Discussion
Forum as the main tool for conveying information about assignments and
due dates.&nbsp; You can also get in touch with me via email <b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mailto:mjwinter@stthomas.edu">mjwinter@stthomas.edu</a></font></b>
<br>if some emergency or problem arises that you think I should know about.
<p>The routine that we will follow will usually consist in this process:
<ul>
<li>
I assign a <b><a href="texts.htm">text</a></b> to be read.</li>

<li>
I provide an <b><a href="assignments.htm">assignment</a></b> to accompany
the reading material.</li>

<li>
I ask you to turn in assignments (via email) by a specific time.</li>
</ul>
Once you have worked on responses to all of the questions:
<ul>
<li>
Listen to audio files that relate to the reading.</li>

<li>
Make contributions to the <b><a href="http://blackboard.stthomas.edu:80/portal/ee_login.jsp">discussion
forum</a></b> on the topic being addressed.</li>
</ul>
I expect that the Discussion Forum will be the place where most of the
teaching and learning will take place in this course.&nbsp; This is the
best place for us to interact with one another.&nbsp; Any thoughts, ideas,
and questions about course topics should be posted there.&nbsp; Email should
usually be used for questions and comments that do not relate directly
to course topics.
<p>You class participation grade will be based on your contibutions to
the discussion forum.&nbsp; I will take the quantity and quality of your
postings into consideration when determining this portion of your grade.&nbsp;
I expect you to make no less than 5 postings in the forum per week.&nbsp;
This is a minimum expectation.&nbsp; Your postings should be spread throughout
the week.
<p>I am really looking forward to working through this material with you.&nbsp;
I expect that this course will be a great learning experience for all of
us.
