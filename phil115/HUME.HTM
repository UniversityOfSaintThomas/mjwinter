<P>from <I>A Treatise of Human Nature</I>

<P>Book 1
<BR>SECT. VI.-Of Personal Identity

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some philosophers who imagine we
are every moment
<BR>intimately conscious of what we call our SELF; that we feel its
<BR>existence and its continuance in existence; and are certain, beyond
the
<BR>evidence of a demonstration, both of its perfect identity and simplicity.
<BR>The strongest sensation, the most violent passion, say they, instead
of
<BR>distracting us from this view, only fix it the more intensely, and
make
<BR>us consider their influence on self either by their pain or pleasure.
To
<BR>attempt a farther proof of this were to weaken its evidence; since
no
<BR>proof can be deriv'd from any fact, of which we are so intimately
<BR>conscious; nor is there any thing, of which we can be certain, if we
<BR>doubt of this.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unluckily all these positive assertions are
contrary to that very
<BR>experience, which is pleaded for them, nor have we any idea of self,
<BR>after the manner it is here explain'd. For from what impression cou'd
<BR>this idea be deriv'd? This question 'tis impossible to answer without
a
<BR>manifest contradiction and absurdity; and yet 'tis a question, which
<BR>must necessarily be answer'd, if we wou'd have the idea of self pass
for
<BR>clear and intelligible, It must be some one impression, that gives
rise to
<BR>every real idea. But self or person is not any one impression, but
that
<BR>to which our several impressions and ideas are suppos'd to have a
<BR>reference. If any impression gives rise to the idea of self, that
<BR>impression must continue invariably the same, thro' the whole course
of
<BR>our lives; since self is suppos'd to exist after that manner. But there
is
<BR>no impression constant and invariable. Pain and pleasure, grief and
joy,
<BR>passions and sensations succeed each other, and never all exist at
the
<BR>same time. It cannot, therefore., be from any of these impressions,
or
<BR>from any other, that the idea of self is deriv'd; and consequently
there
<BR>is no such idea.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But farther, what must become of all our particular
perceptions
<BR>{1:534} upon this hypothesis? All these are different, and
<BR>distinguishable, and separable from each other, and may be separately
<BR>consider'd, and may exist separately, and have no Deed of tiny thing
to
<BR>support their existence. After what manner, therefore, do they belong
<BR>to self; and how are they connected with it? For my part, when I enter
<BR>most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some
<BR>particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love
or
<BR>hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without
a
<BR>perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. When
<BR>my perceptions are remov'd for any time, as by sound sleep; so long
<BR>am I insensible of myself, and may truly be said not to exist. And
were
<BR>all my perceptions remov'd by death, and cou'd I neither think, nor
feel,
<BR>nor see, -nor love, nor hate after the dissolution of my body, I shou'd
be
<BR>entirely annihilated, nor do I conceive what is farther requisite to
make
<BR>me a perfect non-entity. If any one, upon serious and unprejudic'd
<BR>reflection thinks he has a different notion of himself, I must confess
I
<BR>call reason no longer with him. All I can allow him is, that he may
be in
<BR>the right as well as I, and that we are essentially different in this
<BR>particular. He may, perhaps, perceive something simple and continu'd,
<BR>which he calls himself; tho' I am certain there is no such principle
in
<BR>me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But setting aside some metaphysicians of this
kind,. I may
<BR>venture to affirm of the rest of mankind, that they are nothing but
a
<BR>bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other
<BR>with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and
<BR>movement. Our eyes cannot turn in their sockets without varying our
<BR>perceptions. Our thought is still more variable than our sight; and
all
<BR>our other senses and faculties contribute to this change; -nor is there
<BR>any single power of the soul, which remains unalterably the same,
<BR>perhaps for one moment. The mind is a .kind of theatre, where several
<BR>perceptions successively make their appearance; pass, re-pass, glide
<BR>away, and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and situations.
There
<BR>is properly no simplicity in it at one time, nor identity in different;
<BR>whatever natural propension we may have to imagine that simplicity
<BR>and identity. The comparison of the theatre must not mislead us. They
<BR>are the successive perceptions only, that constitute the mind; nor
have
<BR>we the {1:535} most distant notion of the place, where these scenes
are
<BR>represented, or of the materials, of which it is compos'd.
