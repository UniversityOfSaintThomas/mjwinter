was made is only rough.&nbsp; It shows the pace of the course from its
offering last year.&nbsp; Use it only as a general look ahead.)</font></font></b>
<p><b>Week 1</b>
<p>Logic:&nbsp; Square of Opposition. This will be our first logic quiz.
As soon as everyone has taken the quiz, I will release
<br>the quiz results. At that time, you will be able to see how you did.
Everyone should complete quiz #1 by Sunday.
<p>Read section 3 on the Categorical Syllogism on the logic page. You will
not be quizzed on this material this week, but I want you to begin the
exercises and practice quizzes. We will have a quiz next week that covers
section 3. We will try to complete the logic material by the end of week
2.
<p><b>Week 2</b>
<br>Read sections 4-7 of the Logic page. Listen to all of the audio material
on the Logic page. Do all of the remaining exercises and practice quizzes.
We will have a logic quiz that covers the material up through section 4
this week. It will become active on Friday and remain open through Sunday.
<p>Looking ahead some, next week we will take two logic quizzes since we
will be completing the logic unit of the course. Anything on the logic
page will be fair game for these quizzes.
<p>I would suggest that you prepare yourself to know all of the logic material
pretty well by the end of this week.
<p><b>Week 3</b>
<br>We will begin reading Plato this week. The reading assignment is fairly
short due to the fact that I want you to focus on logic too.&nbsp; Do <a href="http://webcampus2.stthomas.edu/courses/mjwinter/phil115/assign1.htm">assignment
#1</a>
<p>Please listen to the first two audio segments found here:
<br>http://webcampus2.stthomas.edu/courses/mjwinter/phil115/plato.htm
<p>Remember that I will begin to keep track of discussion forum postings
this week. The minimum requirement is 5 per week.
<p><b>Week 4</b>
<br>Please do assignment #2 which is found here:
<br>http://webcampus2.stthomas.edu/courses/mjwinter/phil115/assign2.htm
<br>This assignment is due next Sunday.
<p>Please listen to the audio sements: The Theory of Forms, The Cycle of
Opposites Argument, The Recollection Argument, and The Affinity Argument:
<br>http://webcampus2.stthomas.edu/courses/mjwinter/phil115/plato.htm
<p>We will take logic quiz #4 this week (Friday-Sunday). Remember that
all logic quizzes can cover any of the logic material on the logic page
from now on. So part of your assignment for the week is to make sure that
you have all of the logic material down.
<p><b>Week 5</b>
<br>Please do assignment #3 found here:
<br>http://webcampus2.stthomas.edu/courses/mjwinter/phil115/assign3.htm
<p>We will take logic quiz #5 this week. It can cover any of the logic
material.
<p>I plan to assign Paper #1 next week. You can get a preview by going
to the course syllabus and following the Paper link. I do not expect that
you would understand the assignment until we begin the Descartes material
next week.
<p><b>Week 6</b>
<br>Please do assignment #4 found here:
<br>http://webcampus2.stthomas.edu/courses/mjwinter/phil115/assign4.htm

<br>http://webcampus2.stthomas.edu/courses/mjwinter/phil115/descartes.htm
<p>You will be working on your paper and doing a shorter reading during
week 7.
<p>Also, I forgot to mention that you should listen to the last two audio
segments from the Phaedo as part of assignment #3-- misology and final
immortality argument.
<p><b>Week 7</b>
<br>Please read the conversation with Noam Chomsky here:
<br>http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/interviews/92-chase.html
<p>You will not have a formal written assignment this week because you
will be working on the paper that is due this Sunday. But please read the
conversation and discuss it in this folder.
<p>Here are a few questions to think about. What is Chomsky's view about
language? What can the study of language tell us about human nature?&nbsp;
How do Chomsky's ideas about language relate to Plato's ideas about knowledge?
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Week 8</b>
<br>Please do assignment #5 found here:
<br>http://webcampus2.stthomas.edu/courses/mjwinter/phil115/assign5.htm
