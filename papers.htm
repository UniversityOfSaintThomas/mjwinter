<p><b><font color="#000099"><font size=+2>Papers</font></font></b>
<p>There are two short papers required for this course. Papers should be
about 3 (double spaced) pages in length. Written assignments are intended
to provide an opportunity for you to present and assess an argument.&nbsp;
Organization will be weighed heavily, and grammar will count. Each paper
will be worth 15% of&nbsp;
<br>your final grade.&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#000099"><font size=+2>Structure</font></font></b>
<p>I. Introduction&nbsp;
<br>II. Presentation of Argument&nbsp;
<br>III. Assessment of Argument&nbsp;
<br>IV. Conclusion&nbsp;
<p><b>I. Introduction-</b> In this portion of the paper present the question
or thesis you intend to address. You might explain the context in which
the question/thesis occurs. For example, if you are treating Plato's recollection
argument, you might mention how this argument fits into Plato's overall
strategy in the Phaedo.&nbsp;
<p><b>II. Presentation of Argument-</b> Now present the main argument.
For the sake of clarity and organization, state the argument in one of
the forms covered on the logic handout (as has been done in class and in
homework). Use the text to support the premises of the argument. If the
argument is not explicitly stated in any of the forms we have discussed,
see if you are able to make it fit one of the patterns while doing justice
to the intended line of thought (remember the Principle of Charity here).
Explain the stages in the argument and discuss what it purports to show.&nbsp;
<p><b>III. Assessment of Argument-</b> At this stage you will be in a position
to discuss (a) the legitimacy of the inference (valid or invalid) and (b)
the truth or falsity of the premises. Analyze each premise of the argument
by stating the evidence or principles upon which they are based. Discuss
strengths and weaknesses in the argument. Note: This portion of the paper
is where creativity plays its role. Use your imagination to come up with
an example of your own to illustrate the reasoning you employ.&nbsp;
<p><b>IV. Conclusion</b>- A conclusion gives you the opportunity to wrap
things up. Summarize the reasoning and analysis you have employed. Also,
state your own view of the matter. Why are you reluctant or willing to
accept the conclusion? You might state some possible implications of the
argument you assess.&nbsp;
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+2>Assignments</font></font>
<p><b>Paper #1</b>
<p>Below is an argument attempting to prove that we are not brains in vats.&nbsp;
There is a problem with this argument.&nbsp; Where is the problem? I want
you to think about this argument in connection with Descartes’<i> Meditations.</i>
<p>First, explain how this argument connects with Descartes’ Meditations.&nbsp;
Next, explain how the argument below attempts to respond to Descartes’
concerns.&nbsp; Provide a brief explanation of each premise of this argument
in your own words.&nbsp; Once you have explained and justified each of
the premises of this argument, explain which premise is false and why it
is false.&nbsp;
<p>If you think that one of the conditional statements in the argument
is false, then you will need to remember that a conditional statement is
false only when its antecedent is true but its consequent is false.&nbsp;
So, “If it rains, then the ground is wet” is false only when it rains but
the ground is not wet.&nbsp;
<p>Your paper should not exceed three double spaced pages in length.&nbsp;
Remember to remain focused on the argument.&nbsp;
<p><b>An Argument Against the Possibility of Being a Brain in a Vat:</b>
<p><b>Presupposition</b>: A statement is true if and only if the terms
in a statement refer to the realities they designate.&nbsp; A statement
is false or meaningless otherwise.&nbsp;
<p>For example, ‘Grass is green’ is true if and only if grass is green.&nbsp;
<p><b>1) </b><i>Either we are brains in a vat or we are not brains in a
vat.</i>
<br><b>Either -B or B&nbsp;&nbsp; (assumption)</b>
<p><b>2) </b><i>If&nbsp; we are not brains in a vat, then we know that
the sentence ‘We are brains in a vat’ is false.</i>
<br><b>If-B, then F&nbsp; (assumption)</b>
<p><b>3) </b><i>If we are brains in a vat, then we know that the sentence
‘We are brains in a vat’ is false.</i>
<br><b>If B, then F&nbsp; (assumption)</b>
<p><b>4) </b><i>So we know that the sentence ‘We are brains in a vat’ is
false.</i>
<br><b>F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (from 1,2,3)</b>
<p><b>5) </b><i>If we know that the sentence ‘We are brains in a vat’ is
false, then we know that we are not brains in vats.</i>
<br><b>If F, then K&nbsp;&nbsp; (from presupposition)</b>
<p><b>6)</b><i> So we know that we are not brains in vats.</i>
<br><b>K&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (from 4,5)</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Paper #2</b>
<p>Please read <a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/minsky/papers/ComputersCantThink.txt">"Why
People Think Computers Can't" by Marvin Minsky</a>.&nbsp; Your assignment
is to construct, explain and evaluate Minsky's main argument.&nbsp;
<p>1) Find Minsky's main conclusion.&nbsp; What is the point of his article?&nbsp;
<p>2) Construct Minsky's main argument.&nbsp; Find two premises that support
the conclusion in (1) to make a valid argument.&nbsp; I invite you to check
with me after you construct this argument to make sure that you are on
the right track.&nbsp;
<p>3) Explain the premises of Minsky's argument.&nbsp; Use the article
to support the premises you use for the main argument.&nbsp; Explain what
each of the premises means in your own words.&nbsp;
<p>4) Evaluate Minsky's argument.&nbsp; Now that you have explained the
premises of Minsky's argument, explain why the argument is sound or not.&nbsp;
Is the first premise true/false?&nbsp; Why or why not?&nbsp; Is the second
premise true or false?&nbsp; Why or why not?&nbsp; Explain in your own
words why you think Minsky's argument succeeds or fails.&nbsp; Use examples
of your own to support what you say.&nbsp;
