<p class="MsoNormal">Disputed Question with Michael Winter</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">October 9, 2006</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Handout Regarding the Question and Core Definitions and 
Argument</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tom Sullivan</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Draft 1 Oct 3 2006</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Question: Can a purely secular case be made out for fundamental absolute 
rights?&nbsp; [More exactly: Do we by nature alone, i.e., excluding the divine, have 
fundamental absolute right?]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitions:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A human being enjoys an absolute human right if and only if 
there is some kind of action (or omission) A such that it is always wrong 
intentionally to do A to any human or always wrong intentionally to refrain from 
doing A for any human, unless extraordinary means are required.&nbsp; (For example, 
if it is always wrong to lie to any human being, then every human would have an 
absolute right not to be lied to.&nbsp; And, if it is always wrong not to provide 
food to the starving when it is readily available, then every human would have 
an absolute right to be fed.) </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A human being enjoys a fundamental&nbsp; absolute right if and 
only if it is always wrong to assault the innocent or to fail to provide what is 
necessary for life or liberty when ordinary (= proportionate) means for doing so 
are available. (Here “assault” will mean an attempt to damage someone physically 
against that person’s will at the time.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Positions </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My positions expressed at greater length in The Agnositic 
Inquirer, a forthcoming work co-authored with Dr. Sandra Menssen. I should note 
that while the substance of the position was thought through together, since the 
arrangement for this debate was set a few months ago, I’ve worked on the topic 
alone.&nbsp; Dr. Menssen should not be held responsible for any unintentional 
deviations on my part from the view we expressed in The Agnositic Inquirer.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I believe we have fundamental absolute rights, but that we 
do so in virtue of the way God has ordered reality, including life beyond this 
life.&nbsp; I believe the natural law is, as Aquinas said, a participation in the 
eternal law, as Aquinas said, and as popes have said as well.&nbsp; Professor Winter 
concurs in the judgment that there are fundamental absolute rights, but calls 
into question the notion that we have them solely in virtue of a divine 
ordination of natural and supernatural reality.&nbsp; I too call my own position into 
question, inasmuch as, these are difficult matters, and I don’ pretend to have a 
knock-down argument for my position.&nbsp; But tonight it is my job to make out a 
case for my position, and Professor’s Winter’s job to attack it.&nbsp; And so I will 
do my best to make my reasons clear in the allotted time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
word about the position I am going to oppose, the notion that we have 
fundamental absolute rights naturally.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This has great personal pull.&nbsp; As a philosopher I’d like to 
have a purely rational argument for fundamental absolute rights.&nbsp; How else can 
we go into the public square and argue with others who do not share our 
religious views?&nbsp; [I won’t try to answer that question during the presentation, 
but will speak to it during the discussion following the presentations if anyone 
is interested in the issue.] </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Furthermore, I as a philosopher, I am drawn to the kind of 
things that are said about natural law and what is said in the Kantian tradition 
about the dignity of the human person.&nbsp; And as an American I am also taken with 
sonorous proclamation in American Scripture, the Declaration of Independence: 
that the existence of inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness is “self-evident.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguments for the negative</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">5.A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Some considerations that moved me in the direction of thinking the ground must 
be in the divine order of things, before thinking of the suicide argument. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -1.0in; margin-left: 1.5in">Argument 
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The existence of the right, pace Jefferson and others is not 
self-evident.&nbsp; Besides, Jefferson brings in a creator.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -1.0in; margin-left: 1.5in">Argument 
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as removing axioms from a mathematical system will curtain what can 
be derived – think of neutral geometry – so removal of foundation ideas of 
theism and Christianity should be expected to limit the moral “theorems” that 
can be derived.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -1.0in; margin-left: 1.5in">Argument 3&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philosophers who support absolute rights are almost always either believers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -1.0in; margin-left: 1.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -1.0in; margin-left: 1.5in">Argument 
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though it is commonly assumed the Christian tradition is four-square 
behind the notion that fundamental absolute rights are grounded in nature, the 
tradition is anything but crystal clear on the point.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -1.0in; margin-left: 1.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.5in">Think about Aquinas’s definition 
of natural law as a participation in the eternal law, and about the remarks by 
him and others on exemptions from the commandments on the second tablet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.5in">Also see Aquinas on the 
foundation of the old law.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.5in">See Aquinas and Scotus on 
dispensations from the second tablet, prompted by reflection on the alleged 
immortalities” of the patriarchs.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.5in">Though the Church sometimes uses 
Kantian language about treating persons as ends, never solely as means – John 
Paul II was found of this expression -- reference by the church to human dignity 
is almost never in a purely Kantian spirit; reference is almost always made to 
the “image of God” and to divine providence.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -1.0in; margin-left: 1.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -1.0in; margin-left: 1.5in">Argument 
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not easy to find a purely secular argument that establishes the 
positive conclusion.&nbsp; (Ask yourself about your favorite, “Just how does it go, 
from top to bottom?)&nbsp; This is the thought that plagued me.&nbsp; I couldn’t set out 
the argument in satisfactory form, a form that blunted consequentialist 
imaginings about catastrophes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor could I with Alan Donagan dismiss such 
scenarios as “absurd fantasies.” Not in this age of relentless terrorism, 
missing atomic weapons, and anthrax.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -1.0in; margin-left: 1.5in">Argument 
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main defenses – neo-Thomistic and Kantian -- ruled out suicide.&nbsp; And 
this has fundamental consequences for Kantian and Thomistic arguments regarding 
absolute prohibitions and fundamental rights. This thought is elaborated in “The 
Main Argument” immediately following.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -1.0in; margin-left: 1.5in">The Main 
Argument: The Suicide Argument </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If we have fundamental, absolute human rights, then either we have such rights 
naturally or supernaturally.&nbsp; (We have them naturally if we have them whether 
God exists or not; we have them supernaturally only if God exists.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not have fundamental absolute rights 
naturally. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
So, either we do not have fundamental, absolute rights or we do so 
supernaturally.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Premise 1&nbsp; With a bit of explanation of the terms, premise 
1 seems obvious enough.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Premise 2. This requires argument of course.&nbsp; So, here it 
is in outline.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We 
have fundamental absolute rights naturally only if it is necessarily 
impermissible to assault innocents against their will.&nbsp;&nbsp; [Definition of 
“fundamental absolute right.]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
There are times when, leaving God out of the picture, nonexistence is rationally 
preferable to existence.&nbsp; (We can use the phrase “better off dead”, provided we 
mean what was just said about rational preference.)&nbsp; [Assumption]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If 
there are times when, leaving God out of the picture, nonexistence rationally 
preferable to existence, suicide (that is, killing one’s innocent self) is 
morally permissible.&nbsp; [Assumption]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If 
suicide is morally permissible, then it is not necessarily impermissible to kill 
and innocent person.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If 
it is not is not necessarily impermissible to kill and innocent person., then it 
is not necessarily impermissible to kill an innocent person when it is against 
that person’s will.&nbsp; [Assumption]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
So, it is not necessarily impermissible to kill an innocent person when it is 
against that person’s will. [Assumption]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Therefore, we do not have fundamental absolute rights naturally.&nbsp; [Standard 
logic]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in">So goes the outline of the case 
for the idea that God is the foundation of fundamental human rights, just as 
Jefferson hinted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Were I delivering a lecture, I should add objections and 
responses.&nbsp; But happily I can leave the objections to my very able colleague and 
to member of the audience. </p>
