The Basics of Utilitarianism</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
<br>
<br>
Utilitarianism has been quite influential primarily because of its fundamental 
simplicity and its ability to explain a significant range of human choices.&nbsp; At 
the basis of this theory is the &quot;Greatest Happiness Principle&quot; that states:
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;<i>Actions 
are right in proportion to their promotion of happiness, and wrong in proportion 
to their promotion of unhappiness.</i> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
Happiness amounts to pleasure for Mill, who draws a distinction between the 
quantity and the quality of pleasures.&nbsp; Humans are capable of pleasures higher 
in quality than those a beast is capable of enjoying.&nbsp; Intellectual pleasures 
are probably highest on the quality scale while &quot;pleasures of the flesh&quot; are at 
the bottom.&nbsp; So if the sort of pleasure utilitarians consider is restricted to 
the quantity of pleasures as some have thought, then it does seem to be a 
doctrine worthy of swine.&nbsp; If, however, one is willing to acknowledge that some 
pleasures are simply better than others, then it is not so clear that this 
objection will stand. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">So 
how does one apply the Greatest Happiness Principle in particular cases?&nbsp; Since 
we ultimately want to decide which action among some set of alternatives yields 
the most pleasure, it is helpful to assign a standard of measurement: &quot;hedons&quot;.&nbsp; 
A hedon is just a unit of pleasure.&nbsp; So the best action is the one with the best 
sum total of hedons. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Here 
are the steps involved in applying the Greatest Happiness principle: <br>
(1) Determine all alternative actions that could be performed in some situation.
<br>
(2) Assign the appropriate amount of hedons to each alternative action. <br>
(3) Add up the hedons to see which action is best. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
Act Utilitarianism</span></i><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> 
focuses on the net utility of any particular action.&nbsp; The action with the 
greatest number of hedons in comparison with others is the one that ought to be 
performed. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
Rule Utilitarianism </span></i>
<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">focuses on the net utility 
of following certain rules.&nbsp; One must ask him/herself which rule would yield the 
best overall consequences if it were followed. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Both 
versions of utilitarianism are consequentialist in nature, i.e. the consequences 
of actions are of primary moral relevance.&nbsp; Intention, duty, obligation, equity, 
justice and rights are all of (at best) secondary relevance. </span></p>

Problems with Utilitarianism/Consequentialism:</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">-When 
considering the quantity of pleasure (hedons), we must account for both the 
greater amount of pleasure and the greater number of people.&nbsp; Things begin to 
get more complicated.&nbsp; So the theory is not as simple as it appears initially.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">-The 
theory takes no account of equity and justice, both of which seem to be 
important. <br>
Person&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hedons (Case 1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Hedons (Case 2) <br>
&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 <br>
&nbsp; b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 <br>
&nbsp; c&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 <br>
&nbsp; d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 <br>
&nbsp; e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Case 
2 is the more just and equitable, but there is nothing in utilitarianism which 
would suggest that one should opt for Case 2. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">-The 
theory does not take into account personal rights, and thereby abandons the idea 
of human dignity-- that all humans are ends in themselves and should never be 
treated as means to ends. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">-Consequentialism 
leaves open the idea that the ends can justify the means.&nbsp; Reflecting on a few 
cases shows that this principle is unacceptable. </span></p>
