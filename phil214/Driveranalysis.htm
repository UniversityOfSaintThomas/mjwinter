long-standing tenet of virtue theory is that moral virtue and knowledge are
connected in some important way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Plato famously held that virtue and knowledge <span class=GramE>are</span>
simply the same thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Aristotle
had a more complicated view of the matter, distinguishing between moral and
intellectual virtue, and arguing that one specific intellectual virtue, <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>phron&#275;sis</i></span>,
was a necessary condition for having the moral virtues.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Aristotle’s idea, roughly, was that
moral virtues are perfections of different appetites.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But perfection of an appetite consists of aiming at and
reliably hitting the mean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Phron&#275;sis</i></span> is
the perfection or excellence of the part of the intellect that does the
aiming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So, for example, courage
is concerned with actions in the face of fears and danger.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Aristotle’s idea is that the sort of
reliability in choosing what to do in the face of danger in an array of
circumstances requires a stable disposition that enables a person to act
immediately if necessary without having to think the action through.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But this stable disposition is acquired
by having experience, either first-hand or observed, with dangerous situations,
which enables a person to make good judgments about how to react in the face of
danger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The good judgment that
results is capable of shaping one’s own actions, hopefully resulting in habits
with lots of repetition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Having
knowledge to guide the appetites is a key element of this story.<span

always depend on knowledge?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Might
there be moral virtue in the absence of knowledge?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Surely we can think of cases of people who act virtuously
with little or no formal education.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What about the idea of virtues that require ignorance, such as modesty
or humility?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Don’t these virtues
involve underestimating one’s own abilities or accomplishments? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Julia Driver attacks the traditional assumption that virtue requires
knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Overturning this
long-held presupposition is an important part of the case she makes a <span
class=SpellE>consequentialist</span> theory of virtue.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although her presentation of a <span
class=SpellE>consequentialist</span> virtue theory is intriguing and
sophisticated, I will focus on her attack on traditional virtue theory in this
paper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I will argue that the
examples of virtues of ignorance that she offers are not compelling, and that
her argument for the claim that acting from intention is not necessary for
virtue is flawed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a
result, her attempt to sever virtue from knowledge, as interesting and
provocative as it is, should not lead us to abandon the principle that virtue requires
knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the idea
that knowledge is required for virtue has been taken to be foundational for
virtue theory for good reason, and I will try to explain why as I proceed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I will pay particular attention to
Aristotle’s theory of virtue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why think that at
least some virtues depend on ignorance?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consider modesty, blind charity, trust, and forgiveness. (Driver 2001:
Ch.2) Modesty might be taken to involve underestimating one’s own worth.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Blind charity is thinking well of
others in spite of their flaws.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is compelling to say that modesty, when understood this way, and blind charity
involve ignorance in some important way&#8212;the modest make an
underestimation while the blindly charitable fail to recognize character flaws
in others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Doesn’t trust involve
believing in someone even against the evidence?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The old adage “forgive and forget” indicates that a
forgiving person is one who willfully ignores important information about
someone by whom they may have been wronged.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of course, we might wonder whether any of the
aforementioned character traits are genuine virtues.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact they involve ignorance has been taken by some to be
a <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reductio</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> ad absurdum</i> of that claim that they are
virtues. But this type of response begs the more general question posed in this
paper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If we wonder whether some
virtues could require ignorance, we need to consider the candidate virtues that
seem to require ignorance to see whether they in fact do.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It might turn out that some or all of
the proposed virtues of ignorance are not virtues at all, but we cannot simply
claim this up front without assuming what needs to be shown.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Julia Driver takes modesty to be a
“paradigm case of this type of virtue.” (Driver 2001: 16)<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since modesty has been discussed in
recent literature, let’s focus on it for a bit to see whether it does turn out
to be a virtue of ignorance or not. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let’s
step back for a moment and consider the nature of the argument Driver makes for
the conclusion that knowledge is not necessary for virtue.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We might represent it along the
following lines:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>1) If there are
virtues that require ignorance, then there are virtues based on an epistemic
defect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>2) If there are
virtues based on an epistemic defect, then knowledge is not necessary for
virtue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>3) There are
virtues that require ignorance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>4) So, knowledge
is not necessary for virtue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
premise (1) seems correct to the extent that we think of ignorance as an
epistemic defect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As long as we
think of a defect broadly, as some type of deficiency, then this claim is
uncontroversial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(2) is more
ambitious, but looks right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
there is even one case where a character trait that we would acknowledge as
being a virtue that is based on or requires some type of epistemic deficiency,
it appears like we will have to give up on the idea that virtue requires knowledge.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to keep in
mind that Driver only needs one good example of a virtue of ignorance to
establish (3), and she features modesty as her best specimen.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(3) <span class=GramE>is</span> the
claim I do not accept.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am not
convinced that modesty, when properly understood, requires ignorance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What I will need to do if offer a
better account of modesty, one that better explains cases of what we would
ordinarily identify as exemplars of modesty, than the one Driver offers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If this alternative account has at
least as much explanatory power as the alternative proposed, then there is not
good reason for accepting (3).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It might be helpful
to begin with some idea of how modesty is usually understood so that we are in
a good position to see problems and obstacles that any proposal might have to
overcome.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Let’s begin
with the theological conception of modesty, which involves thinking that any
value in one’s own accomplishments is attributable to God, but any defects in
one’s own deeds are not attributable to God. (<span class=SpellE>Schueler</span>
1997: 471) If we take this view seriously, then a Nobel Prize winner who defers
praise is modest because her winning the prize is due to gifts she has been
given by God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As impressive as the
faith of such individuals might be, one serious problem with this conception of
modesty is, as G.F Schuler points out, “it makes the low- opinion account of
modesty (or humility) plausible only at the cost of holding that no one ever
genuinely deserves credit for any of her successes.” (<span class=SpellE>Schueler</span>
1997: 471)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the
theological account of modesty that makes all of our accomplishments
attributable to God has the implication that nobody ever really deserves to be
praised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it does seem that
people do deserve praise in at least some cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, this proposal requires accepting some sort of
belief in God, which will be problematic for many.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Schueler</span>
offers an alternative account, which involves having made significant
accomplishments but not caring whether others value these accomplishments
highly. (<span class=SpellE>Schueler</span> 1997: 479)<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So, by this account, the Nobel
Prize winner is modest because he is indifferent to the praise bestowed on him
by others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Notice that according
to both this account and the theological account, modesty involves knowledge of
one’s abilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The theological
account makes God responsible for these abilities, and thereby deserving of any
praise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span class=SpellE>Schueler’s</span>
account makes the individual knowledgeable of his accomplishments and the
appropriate object of praise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What is distinctive about <span class=SpellE>Schueler’s</span> account
is the attitudinal shift in the recipient of praise&#8212;the indifference to
praise is what makes such a person modest.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are a couple of problems with <span
class=SpellE>Schueler’s</span> proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>First, it would seem that the modest would care, at least in some
respect, about the opinions of others.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn'

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, <span class=SpellE>Schueler’s</span>
account seems too strong in requiring this indifference, for as least some
modest people might really care about what others think about their accomplishments.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A further concern is that a person who
is modest in this sense might not care about the opinions of others for some
bad reason.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They may have contempt
for the views of everyone. (Driver 2001: 23)<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As an
alternative, let’s consider the following account of modesty, which I think
captures most of our intuitions about what the virtue involves while avoiding
some of <span class=GramE>the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>problems</span> just mentioned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

accomplishments, b) being aware of the value of these accomplishments, and c)
having a disposition to refrain from putting forward one’s

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

to be contested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Modesty does not
really apply to cases where someone has not accomplished something significant.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(b) <span class=GramE>is</span> a
condition that fits with more traditional accounts of modesty.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, Aristotle does not offer a
set of necessary and sufficient conditions that separate modesty from its
excess and defect, but he does insist that modest involve truthfulness and
awareness about what one has accomplished. (<span class=SpellE><u>Nicomachean</u></span><u>

offering makes explicit a condition which is, at most, implicit in traditional
characterizations of modesty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now that we have
before us an alternative account of modesty that requires that the modest
person be knowledgeable, let us focus our attention back on premise (3) from Driver’s
argument above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are there
virtues that require ignorance?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>How does Driver’s contention that modesty requires ignorance fare in
comparison to the account just proposed?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Driver begins with her own analysis with the sentence “I am modest”,
thinking that a good account of modesty should explain the oddity of uttering
this sentence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I think there
are situations in which the claim would be odd, such as ones in which someone
proudly or publicly proclaims the virtue of modesty.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It is contexts of this sort that probably function as
backdrop for this claim when we first think of it being made.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But there are cases in which uttering
the claim would not be so odd.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Imagine
that an eminent cellist who is not disposed to highlight her own skills is
asked to give a speech entitled “What it is like to be the world’s premier
cellist.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When asked, the star
musician might not recommend that someone else give the speech, realizing that
she is the world’s premier musician in her field.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But the cellist, not wanting to offend, might decline by
privately saying “I am modest.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There doesn’t seem to be anything unusual about saying “I am modest” in
this context because an honest person is forced by the circumstances to state
what is known to be the truth even though such a person is inclined not to make
public proclamations about the superiority of their own musical abilities.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consider the example
of Erik <span class=SpellE>Demaine</span>, a whiz kid who entered university at
age 12 and finished at age 14, was hired as a faculty member at MIT at the ripe
of age of 20.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When interviewed by
PBS about some groundbreaking work of his related to using computer models to
create brilliant <span class=SpellE>Oragami</span> puzzles, he insisted that
his status as a child prodigy was irrelevant to his current work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We see here the same sort of pattern as
in the other examples of modesty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Someone has a characteristic or accomplishment that is unusually
exemplary, so much so that others want to highlight it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The recipient of praise, who is modest,
does not deny the accomplishment, but rather wishes not to focus on it.<span

business, shows genuine modesty when he attributes much of his success to
luck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Outliers</u> Malcolm <span

good fortune a much more important factor in his climb to the top of the
computer industry than we might think.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After telling the story of Gates’ early formation, <span class=SpellE>Gladwell</span>
summarizes the features of Gates’ good fortune and opportunity:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Opportunity
number one was that Gates got sent to Lakeside.<span style="mso-spacerun:

time-sharing terminal in 1968?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Opportunity number two was that the mothers of Lakeside had enough money
to pay for the school’s computer fees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Number three was that, when the money ran out, one of the parents
happened to work at C-Cubed, which happened to need someone to check its code
on the weekends, and which also happened not to care if weekends turned into
weeknights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Number four was that
Gates just happened to find out about ISI, and ISI just happened to need
someone to work on its payroll software.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Number five was that Gates happened to live within walking distance of
the University of Washington.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Number six was that the university happened to have free computer time
between three and six in the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Number seven was that TRW happened to call Bud Pembroke.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Number eight was that the best
programmers Pembroke knew for that particular problem happened to be two high
school kids.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And number nine was
that Lakeside was willing to let those kids spend their spring term miles away,
writing code. (<span class=SpellE>Gladwell</span> 2008: 54)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Reflecting
back on these early experiences that made his future accomplishments possible,
and when asked how many teenagers in the world had this kind of experience,
Gates said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“If
there were fifty in the world, I would be stunned.<span style="mso-spacerun:

TRW&#8212;all those things came together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I had a better exposure to software development at a young age than I
think anyone did in that period of time, and all because of incredibly lucky
series of events.” (<span class=SpellE>Gladwell</span> 2008: 55)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
of course, to emphasize the role of good fortune in this story is not to
minimize some of the personal qualities and skills needed to become one the
world’s top business leaders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
Gates does not mention the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is striking that Gates would highlight what <span class=GramE>an
important</span> role luck had played in making possible the circumstances that
allowed him to flourish in business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is a good illustration of modesty, I think.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many people would have highlighted
their own abilities, but a modest person tends not to focus on those.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They tend to recognize the importance
of factors outside of their control instead.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This real example of modesty does not seem to rest on
ignorance at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similar things
should be said about the other alleged virtues of ignorance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Blind charity, insofar is it involves
ignoring someone’s defects, is not a virtue at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Someone who fails to see the shortcomings of others is
putting himself in a potentially dangerous or hurtful situation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Suppose I am dating someone who is rude
and offensive to others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Isn’t it
likely that these character defects will do our relationship harm in the long
run?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is it really possible for a
good person to overlook such shortcomings indefinitely?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, we admire people who try to
highlight the strengths of others and who do not focus on shortcomings, but
this takes place in the context of knowing full well what those shortcomings
are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Placing trust in others requires
faith in another person’s character, and faith goes beyond what is strictly
known, but this does not imply that trust requires ignorance in the relevant
sense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To trust someone with a
secret is to share with them information with the expectation that they will
not share it with others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
usually become vulnerable in trusting others, and this is why we place trust in
those who we find trustworthy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, based on what we know about a person, we expect that they might be
worthy of keeping a secret.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Trust
seems to be based on knowledge as much as modesty does.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We are reluctant to trust people about
whom we know little.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And finally,
when we forgive and forget, we give up a grudge we have against someone for a
wrong they may have done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
overcome our anger so that our relationship can get on.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But this does not mean that we entirely
block the event to be forgiven out of mind.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If my daughter does something to severely betray my trust
and I discover this, I may with time come to a point where I forgive her, which
means I have overcome my anger toward her for her transgression, but this does
not mean that I completely block the event out of my mind forever.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is highly unlikely that this is even
psychologically possible.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So what I am
proposing is that we should reject premise (3) of Driver’s argument for the
conclusion that virtue does not require knowledge because we have a good
account of modesty that seems to explain why genuine cases of modesty should be
classified as virtues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no
solid reason to think that virtues do not require knowledge. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman"'>Continuing with the attack on traditional virtue theory,
Driver attempts to sever good intentions from virtue.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pattern is of argumentation is similar to what we
have seen already.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is a
traditional view, going back at least as far as the Greeks, that has it that
acting virtuously requires having good intentions.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But close examination seems to reveal that this assumption
about the relationship between virtue and good intentions is unfounded.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, we should give up virtue
theory as it has been traditionally conceived.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here is a formulation of the main argument:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>3a) If a person
can act virtuously from feeling but against what he takes to be right, then
acting virtuously does not require good intentions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>3b) <span
class=GramE>A</span> person can act virtuously from feeling but against what he

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>3c) Acting
virtuously does not require good intentions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(3a)
is based on what is means to act from good intentions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We can understand this claim as
being based on what it means to have good intentions.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Let’s just stipulate that acting from good intentions is
acting on the basis of what a person understands to be right.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(3b) is a controversial claim and
Driver is quite aware that it requires support and elaboration.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The claim is to a large extent
supported by the example of Huck Finn who in <u>The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn</u> is portrayed by Mark Twain as having a bad morality. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>At least this is the way that <span
class=GramE>Huck’s morality is classified by Jonathan Bennett</span> in his
widely anthologized article <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The
Conscience of Huckleberry Finn</i>. (Bennett 1974) Huck believes that slavery
is right, which is the main reason we would say his morality is bad.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He accepts a bad moral principle that
is widely embraced in his culture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After helping to free his slave friend Jim, the pangs of conscience
bother Huck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He thinks he may have
done the wrong thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
subsequently sets his mind to turning Jim in, but realizes that he cannot do
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His feelings for Jim are
apparently too strong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Huck cannot
bring himself to do what he thinks is morally right.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jonathan Bennett characterizes
this conflict in Huck as a case of weakness of will.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He states his main point eloquently:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>“ And when the moment for final decision
come, Huck doesn’t weigh up pros and cons; he simply fails to do which he
believes to be right&#8212;he isn’t strong enough, hasn’t “the spunk of a
rabbit.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This passage in the novel
is notable not just for its finely wrought irony, with Huck’s weakness of will
leading him to do the right thing, but also for its masterly handling of the
difference between general moral principles and particular unreasoned emotional
pulls. (Bennett 1974: 31)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
fact that Bennett describes Huck’s situation as involving weakness of the will
indicates that Bennett is not saying that feeling can take the place of
principles in practical reasoning, but rather that feelings might overpower or
override certain kinds of principles&#8212;what Aristotle calls particulars or
minor premises of practical syllogisms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Weakness of the will involves a conflict between knowledge and action,
but the knowledge of a more general principle must be in place for there to be
a conflict at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
agree with Bennett that Huck Finn demonstrates weakness of will, albeit
weakness of a strange sort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

Driver does not understand the Huck Finn case along traditional Aristotelian
lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, she takes Huck to
exemplify how (3b) is true.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Huck
does the fails to turn in Jim in spit of moral principles he holds that militate
against this course of action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Huck is moved by his feelings for Jim and not by moral principles.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“It
is Huckleberry’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sympathy</i> with Jim

interpreting the sympathy he feels for Jim as some sort of unwarranted
favoritism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It would be the sort
of favoritism condemned by morality as being incompatible with justice.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jim is his friend, but it is not
morally permissible to aid one’s friends in crime, in stealing property from a
little old lady.” (Driver 2001: 53)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
if Huck’s situation is best understood as being a case in which a person does
the right thing and acts virtuously from feeling against we he takes to be
right, then it looks like the general thesis that virtue requires acting from
good intentions is false.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
would be a serious blow to a traditional understanding to virtue theory.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I think we should be reluctant to
accept this result because I don’t think (3b) follows from the Huck Finn
example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the next section I
will offer an analysis of that case from the point of view of a more
traditional approach to Aristotelian virtue theory.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I will argue that since this explanation offers a good
account of what is going on with Huck without giving up on the idea that action
virtuously requires having good intentions, that we should embrace this
explanation instead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, there is an issue of burden of proof that Dryer’s challenge faces, and I
don’t think the challenge has met this burden. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

about the Aristotelian analysis of weakness of will because I think doing so
puts us in a better position to understand how moral principles and feelings
might interact and even conflict with one another.<span style="mso-spacerun:

weakness involves a conflict between knowledge and action-- a person acts
against what he or she takes to be correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Socrates thought that genuine conflicts of this sort would
be impossible because allowing for conflicts between knowledge and action seems
to imply that knowledge could be overpowered by desire.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But if that is possible, then knowledge
would not be the ruling element within us.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>So these principles seem to lead to a denial of genuine
weakness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In responding to
Socrates, Aristotle argues that weakness involves ignorance, but only a
qualified type of ignorance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
distinguishes between ignorance of general principles and ignorance of
particulars, and says that weakness only involves ignorance of the latter.<span

practical syllogism is a tool for explaining how we put our moral principles
into practice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It has a major

if I accept the moral principle that lying is wrong, and I see that telling my

this form of reasoning from going through.<span style="mso-spacerun:

portrayal of Huck Finn’s moral weakness leading to the right action is clever
and striking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Equally striking is
the recognition that Aristotle seemed to be aware of this sort of
situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Early in his discussion
of weakness of the will when dealing with preliminary considerations, Aristotle
says:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“There
is an argument from which it follows that folly coupled with incontinence is
virtue; for a man does the opposite of what he judges, owing to incontinence,
but judges what is good to be evil and something that he should not do, and in
consequence he will do what is good and not what is evil.” (<span class=SpellE><u>Nicomachean</u></span><u>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is noteworthy that he classifies the idea that such a state of affairs could
come from virtue as a “sophistical argument.”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Aristotle does not furnish us with a direct response to this
argument, but he apparently believes that his analysis of weakness contains the
elements that provide a response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We shall soon consider how that analysis might apply to Huck Finn’s
case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, it should be
noted that Driver seems to confuse being virtuous and doing the right
thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Huck does the right thing,
but he is not virtuous because he fails to have a virtuous disposition.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>According to a more traditional
understanding of virtue theory, having a virtuous disposition and doing the
right thing are not equivalent because having a virtuous disposition requires
doing the right thing for the right reasons. (<u>NE</u>1105a17-1105b5) Driver
foresees this Aristotelian response and says the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“Many
writers on virtue, particularly those concerned with defending the Aristotelian
position, will argue that Huck Finn is not a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

is because there is a psychological failure present: his feelings and his moral
understanding are not in harmony.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

it is not only the lack of harmony between feelings and understanding that is
problematic from an Aristotelian point of view. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>It is also the ignorance of the appropriate moral principle
in this peculiar case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In any
event, Driver responds by noting that the Aristotelian stance, that Huck is not
virtuous, follows from an elitist conception of virtue where the virtuous
person stands above us ordinary folks as a moral exemplar.<span

as being “about as <span class=SpellE>nonelitist</span> as one could hope for.”

to this elitism, in her view, is that it is concerned with making the virtuous

Finn has a certain feeling, most likely compassion, for Jim in a specific set

deliberately on that feeling only because he has internalized moral principles,

produce an action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Huck accepts a
principle about compassion which is difficult to articulate given what we know
about the story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be a very
specific principle such as:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the two principles mentioned above, for example, is too specific to have the
sort of repeatability to get the reliability that Driver finds in Huck’s

stems from Huck’s compassion, but is still not a very refined moral principle
as stated because it leaves room for morally illicit means.<span

capable of directing deliberate action, and given what we know about Huck’s
character from the rest of the novel, it seems like a plausible principle to
attribute to Huck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If we apply
something like what Aristotle offers for explaining actions, we might get some
variation of the following schema of practical reasoning:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ought to do good”, “one ought to be kind”, and so on.<span style="mso-spacerun:

knowledge conflicts with action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

competing moral principles, and at least one of these ultimately overrides a
principle of his bad morality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So
at this level of analysis, there is not a battle between sympathy and moral principle,
but a battle between conflicting moral principles.<span style="mso-spacerun:

place within the context of the tension between competing moral principles.<span

considerations that would enable one type of moral principle to be operative,
but we should not ignore the fact that competing principles are often at work
