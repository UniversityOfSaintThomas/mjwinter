<b><font size=+2>Kant's Categorical Imperative</font></b>
<p>The categorical imperative is an unconditional principle that all human
beings are morally obligated to observe in virtue of the fact that we are
rational agents. Rationality requires that we observe the CI so as to attain
consistency in what we will as rational agents. Rationality itself is the
basis for the principle; it is not based (inductively) on experience.
<p>(CI) <i>Act as though the maxim of your action were by your will to
become a universal law of nature</i>.
<p>To apply CI we need to:
<p>1) Formulate the maxim.
<br>2) Generalize the maxim.
<br>3) Determine if (2) can be consistently willed.
<p><b>Maxim</b>: When I am in circumstances C and have purpose P, I will
do action A.
<p><b>Generalized Maxim:</b> Whenever anyone is in circumstances C and
has purpose P, they will do action A.
<p>Can GM be consistently willed? If yes, then the action is morally permissible.
If no, then the action is forbidden.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>Problems with CI:</font>
<p>**Maxim may be too specific**
<br>**CI may get wrong results**
<p><b>2nd Formulation:</b> <i>Act so that you treat humanity, whether in
your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a
means only.</i>
<p>-This principle is intimately connected with the concept of human dignity
which is the idea that human rationality requires that human beings be
treated as ends and never as means. Since rationality involves both the
capacity to think and choose, respecting human dignity means that every
human beings should at least be provided with an opportunity to activate
these capacities and not be regarded in a way incompatible with the fulfillment
of them; every capacity has a natural tendency toward
<br>its own fulfillment.
<p>-We should expect a principle like this to one of the most fundamental
truths in ethics. If we deny the principle, what is left?
