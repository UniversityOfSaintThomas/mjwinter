<font size=+1>Aristotle on Weakness of Will</font>
<p>What Aristotle calls 'incontinence' we will call weakness of will.&nbsp;
Remember that the central question we want to consider in relation to Bk.
7 is whether or not weakness of will is possible?&nbsp; Another way of
putting this is: Is incontinence possible?&nbsp; The idea is that someone
knows that a particular action is right or wrong but acts contrary to his
knowledge.&nbsp; Socrates says that these two states of affairs are incompatible,
so the person must not have knowledge.
<p>Aristotle's questions-
<br>What are continence and incontinence?
<br>How does continence related to temperance and incontinence to intemperance?
<br>How does one explain incontinence?
<p>&nbsp; Socrates view that weakness of will is impossible is initially
rejected by Aristotle because it conflicts with common sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Socrates would think that someone’s knowing that smoking is bad for them
, for example, but doing it anyway could only be explained by saying that
the person does not genuinely know that smoking is bad for them.&nbsp;
Aristotle disagrees.&nbsp; He thinks that a person could know that smoking
is bad for them but still fail to do it-- this would be a case of weakness
of the will.
<p>Both <a href="weaknesscomparison.html">continence/incontinence and temperance/intemperance</a>
are concerned with bodily pleasure-- how much to eat and drink.&nbsp; Temperance
is a genuine virtue; it is the best of these states.&nbsp; Continence is
strength of will; it is not a full virtue-- it is next best.&nbsp; Incontinence
is weakness of will-- it is worse yet.&nbsp; Intemperance is a genuine
vice-- it is the worst of the four states.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Aristotle's Analysis of Weakness</b>
<p>Aristotle frames the issue with reference to the <a href="weakness.html">practical
syllogism</a>.&nbsp; The practical syllogism is a model for explaining
action.&nbsp; In other words, we can use this model to understand and analyze
actions.
<p>Major Premise:&nbsp; Actions of kind X ought/ought not be done.
<br>Minor Premise:&nbsp; This is an action of kind X.
<br>Conclusion:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This ought/ought
not to be done.
<p>The major premise is a general moral principle.&nbsp; The minor premise
subsumes a particular action under a general moral principle.&nbsp; The
conclusion tells us how to act.
<p>Suppose that your friend Smith asks you to look after his pet poodle
while he is out of town for the week.&nbsp; You yourself have a dog, a
St. Bernard, so you figure that it will not be much trouble to have a second
dog around for the week.&nbsp; You tell Smith that you will watch after
the dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing you don't foresee is that your own
dog has grown used to his own space.&nbsp; So on the first day of your
dogsitting adventure you come home to find Smith's poodle ripped to shreds
and spread throughout the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Smith calls you on this evening
and asks you how everything is going with his dog.
<p><i>All acts of lying are not to be done.</i>
<br><i><u>Telling Smith that his dog is fine is a lie.</u></i>
<br><i>Telling Smith that his dog is fine is not to be done.</i>
<p>Now suppose that this is a genuine case of incontinence.&nbsp; You know
that you should tell the truth, but your inclination is to tell a lie in
this case.&nbsp; So you tell Smith that everything is fine with his dog,
hoping to find some way of diplomatically dealing with the situation.
<p>What would Aristotle's analysis look like?&nbsp; He would say that you
understand the universal major premise-- as a matter of fact you know it.&nbsp;
Now the minor premise deals with particular actions-- it is here that things
are more complicated.&nbsp; What happens is that your desire to be diplomatic
and not offend Smith in some sense blinds you from seeing that the particular
story you are about to tell Smith is a lie-- in fact you may even come
up with rationalizations to this effect, e.g. it really isn't a lie since
I will eventually have to tell Smith what happened anyway.&nbsp; So in
your incontinence your desire overcomes your grasp of the minor premise.&nbsp;
-The major premise is universal and hence is related to knowledge to the
full extent.
<br>-The minor premise is particular, so ignorance of it is not ignorance
to the full extent.
<p>So Aristotle's refined account seems to allow for weakness of will.&nbsp;
We know what we should do (major premise), but we act contrary to this
knowledge (our desire is stronger than our present grasp of the minor as
an instance of the major).
