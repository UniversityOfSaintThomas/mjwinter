<b>Whether it is unlawful to kill any living thing?</b>
<p>&nbsp;OBJ 1: It would seem unlawful to kill any living thing. For the
Apostle says (Rm. 13:2): "They that resist the ordinance of God purchase
to themselves damnation [*Vulg.: 'He that resisteth the power, resisteth
the ordinance of God: and they that resist, purchase themselves damnation.']."
Now Divine providence has ordained that all living things should be preserved,
according to Ps. 146:8,9, "Who maketh grass to grow on the mountains .
. . Who giveth to beasts their food." Therefore it seems unlawful to take
the life of any living thing.
<br>&nbsp;OBJ 2: Further, murder is a sin because it deprives a man of
life. Now life is common to all animals and plants. Hence for the same
reason it is apparently a sin to slay dumb animals and plants.
<br>&nbsp;OBJ 3: Further, in the Divine law a special punishment is not
appointed save for a sin. Now a special punishment had to be inflicted,
according to the Divine law, on one who killed another man's ox or sheep
(Ex. 22:1). Therefore the slaying of dumb animals is a sin.
<p>&nbsp;On the contrary, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei i, 20): "When we
hear it said, 'Thou shalt not kill,' we do not take it as referring to
trees, for they have no sense, nor to irrational animals, because they
have no fellowship with us. Hence it follows that the words, 'Thou shalt
not kill' refer to the killing of a man."
<br>&nbsp;I answer that, There is no sin in using a thing for the purpose
for which it is. Now the order of things is such that the imperfect are
for the perfect, even as in the process of generation nature proceeds from
imperfection to perfection. Hence it is that just as in the generation
of a man there is first a living thing, then an animal, and lastly a man,
so too things, like the plants, which merely have life, are all alike for
animals, and all animals are for man. Wherefore it is not unlawful if man
use plants for the good of animals, and animals for the good of man, as
the Philosopher states (Polit. i, 3).
<br>&nbsp;Now the most necessary use would seem to consist in the fact
that animals use plants, and men use animals, for food, and this cannot
be done unless these be deprived of life: wherefore it is lawful both to
take life from plants for the use of animals, and from animals for the
use of men. In fact this is in keeping with the commandment of God Himself:
for it is written (Gn. 1:29,30): "Behold I have given you every herb .
. . and all trees . . . to be your meat, and to all beasts of the earth":
and again (Gn. 9:3): "Everything that moveth and liveth shall be meat to
you."
<br>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 1: According to the Divine ordinance the life of animals
and plants is preserved not for themselves but for man. Hence, as Augustine
says (De Civ. Dei i, 20), "by a most just ordinance of the Creator, both
their life and their death are subject to our use."
<br>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 2: Dumb animals and plants are devoid of the life of
reason whereby to set themselves in motion; they are moved, as it were
by another, by a kind of natural impulse, a sign of which is that they
are naturally enslaved and accommodated to the uses of others.
<br>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 3: He that kills another's ox, sins, not through killing
the ox, but through injuring another man in his property. Wherefore this
is not a species of the sin of murder but of the sin of theft or robbery.
<p><b>Whether it is lawful to kill sinners?</b>
<p>&nbsp;I answer that, As stated above (A1), it is lawful to kill dumb
animals, in so far as they are naturally directed to man's use, as the
imperfect is directed to the perfect. Now every part is directed to the
whole, as imperfect to perfect, wherefore every part is naturally for the
sake of the whole. For this reason we observe that if the health of the
whole body demands the excision of a member, through its being decayed
or infectious to the other members, it will be both praiseworthy and advantageous
to have it cut away. Now every individual person is compared to the whole
community, as part to whole. Therefore if a man be dangerous and infectious
to the community, on account of some sin, it is praiseworthy and advantageous
that he be killed in order to safeguard the common good, since "a little
leaven corrupteth the whole lump" (1 Cor. 5:6).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reply OBJ 3: By sinning man departs from the
order of reason, and consequently falls away from the dignity of his manhood,
in so far as he is naturally free, and exists for himself, and he falls
into the slavish state of the beasts, by being disposed of according as
he is useful to others. This is expressed in Ps. 48:21: "Man, when he was
in honor, did not understand; he hath been compared to senseless beasts,
and made like to them," and Prov. 11:29: "The fool shall serve the wise."
Hence, although it be evil in itself to kill a man so long as he preserve
his dignity, yet it may be good to kill a man who has sinned, even as it
is to kill a beast. For a bad man is worse than a beast, and is more harmful,
as the Philosopher states (Polit. i, 1 and Ethic. vii, 6).
<p><b>Whether it is lawful to kill a man in self defense?</b>
<p>&nbsp;OBJ 1: It would seem that nobody may lawfully kill a man in self
defense. For Augustine says to Publicola (Ep. xlvii): "I do not agree with
the opinion that one may kill a man lest one be killed by him; unless one
be a soldier, exercise a public office, so that one does it not for oneself
but for others, having the power to do so, provided it be in keeping with
one's person." Now he who kills a man in self defense, kills him lest he
be killed by him. Therefore this would seem to be unlawful.
<br>&nbsp;OBJ 2: Further, he says (De Lib. Arb. i, 5): "How are they free
from sin in sight of Divine providence, who are guilty of taking a man's
life for the sake of these contemptible things?" Now among contemptible
things he reckons "those which men may forfeit unwillingly," as appears
from the context (De Lib. Arb. i, 5): and the chief of these is the life
of the body. Therefore it is unlawful for any man to take another's life
for the sake of the life of his own body.
<br>&nbsp;OBJ 4: Further, murder is a more grievous sin than fornication
or adultery. Now nobody may lawfully commit simple fornication or adultery
or any other mortal sin in order to save his own life; since the spiritual
life is to be preferred to the life of the body. Therefore no man may lawfully
take another's life in self defense in order to save his own life.
<br>&nbsp;OBJ 5: Further, if the tree be evil, so is the fruit, according
to Mt. 7:17. Now self defense itself seems to be unlawful, according to
Rm. 12:19: "Not defending [Douay: 'revenging'] yourselves, my dearly beloved."
Therefore its result, which is the slaying of a man, is also unlawful.
<p>&nbsp;On the contrary, It is written (Ex. 22:2): "If a thief be found
breaking into a house or undermining it, and be wounded so as to die; he
that slew him shall not be guilty of blood." Now it is much more lawful
to defend one's life than one's house. Therefore neither is a man guilty
of murder if he kill another in defense of his own life.
<p>&nbsp;I answer that, Nothing hinders one act from having two effects,
only one of which is intended, while the other is beside the intention.
Now moral acts take their species according to what is intended, and not
according to what is beside the intention, since this is accidental as
explained above (Q43, A3; FS, Q12, A1). Accordingly the act of self defense
may have two effects, one is the saving of one's life, the other is the
slaying of the aggressor. Therefore this act, since one's intention is
to save one's own life, is not unlawful, seeing that it is natural to everything
to keep itself in "being," as far as possible. And yet, though proceeding
from a good intention, an act may be rendered unlawful, if it be out of
proportion to the end. Wherefore if a man, in self defense, uses more than
necessary violence, it will be unlawful: whereas if he repel force with
moderation his defense will be lawful, because according to the jurists
[*Cap. Significasti, De Homicid. volunt. vel casual.], "it is lawful to
repel force by force, provided one does not exceed the limits of a blameless
defense." Nor is it necessary for salvation that a man omit the act of
moderate self defense in order to avoid killing the other man, since one
is bound to take more care of one's own life than of another's. But as
it is unlawful to take a man's life, except for the public authority acting
for the common good, as stated above (A3), it is not lawful for a man to
intend killing a man in self defense, except for such as have public authority,
who while intending to kill a man in self defense, refer this to the public
good, as in the case of a soldier fighting against the foe, and in the
minister of the judge struggling with robbers, although even these sin
if they be moved by private animosity.
<br>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 1: The words quoted from Augustine refer to the case
when one man intends to kill another to save himself from death. The passage
quoted in the Second Objection is to be understood in the same sense. Hence
he says pointedly, "for the sake of these things," whereby he indicates
the intention. This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.
<br>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 3: Irregularity results from the act though sinless
of taking a man's life, as appears in the case of a judge who justly condemns
a man to death. For this reason a cleric, though he kill a man in self
defense, is irregular, albeit he intends not to kill him, but to defend
himself.
<br>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 4: The act of fornication or adultery is not necessarily
directed to the preservation of one's own life, as is the act whence sometimes
results the taking of a man's life.
<br>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 5: The defense forbidden in this passage is that which
comes from revengeful spite. Hence a gloss says: "Not defending yourselves&nbsp;&nbsp;
that is, not striking your enemy back."
