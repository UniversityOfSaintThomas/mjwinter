<blockquote>
<blockquote><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>THERE ARE few circumstances
among those which make up the present condition of human knowledge, more
unlike what might have been expected, or more significant of the backward
state in which speculation on the most important subjects still lingers,
than the little progress which has been made in the decision of the controversy
respecting the criterion of right and wrong. From the dawn of philosophy,
the question concerning the summum bonum, or, what is the same thing, concerning
the foundation of morality, has been accounted the main problem in speculative
thought, has occupied the most gifted intellects, and divided them into
sects and schools, carrying on a vigorous warfare against one another.
And after more than two thousand years the same discussions continue, philosophers
are still ranged under the same contending banners, and neither thinkers
nor mankind at large seem nearer to being unanimous on the subject, than
when the youth Socrates listened to the old Protagoras, and asserted (if
Plato's dialogue be grounded on a real conversation) the theory of utilitarianism
against the popular morality of the so-called sophist.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>It is true that similar confusion
and uncertainty, and in some cases similar discordance, exist respecting
the first principles of all the sciences, not excepting that which is deemed
the most certain of them, mathematics; without much impairing, generally
indeed without impairing at all, the trustworthiness of the conclusions
of those sciences. An apparent anomaly, the explanation of which is, that
the detailed doctrines of a science are not usually deduced from, nor depend
for their evidence upon, what are called its first principles. Were it
not so, there would be no science more precarious, or whose conclusions
were more insufficiently made out, than algebra; which derives none of
its certainty from what are commonly taught to learners as its elements,
since these, as laid down by some of its most eminent teachers, are as
full of fictions as English law, and of mysteries as theology. The truths
which are ultimately accepted as the first principles of a science, are
really the last results of metaphysical analysis, practised on the elementary
notions with which the science is conversant; and their relation to the
science is not that of foundations to an edifice, but of roots to a tree,
which may perform their office equally well though they be never dug down
to and exposed to light. But though in science the particular truths precede
the general theory, the contrary might be expected to be the case with
a practical art, such as morals or legislation. All action is for the sake
of some end, and rules of action, it seems natural to suppose, must take
their whole character and colour from the end to which they are subservient.
When we engage in a pursuit, a clear and precise conception of what we
are pursuing would seem to be the first thing we need, instead of the last
we are to look forward to. A test of right and wrong must be the means,
one would think, of ascertaining what is right or wrong, and not a consequence
of having already ascertained it.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>The difficulty is not avoided by
having recourse to the popular theory of a natural faculty, a sense or
instinct, informing us of right and wrong. For- besides that the existence
of such- a moral instinct is itself one of the matters in dispute- those
believers in it who have any pretensions to philosophy, have been obliged
to abandon the idea that it discerns what is right or wrong in the particular
case in hand, as our other senses discern the sight or sound actually present.
Our moral faculty, according to all those of its interpreters who are entitled
to the name of thinkers, supplies us only with the general principles of
moral judgments; it is a branch of our reason, not of our sensitive faculty;
and must be looked to for the abstract doctrines of morality, not for perception
of it in the concrete. The intuitive, no less than what may be termed the
inductive, school of ethics, insists on the necessity of general laws.
They both agree that the morality of an individual action is not a question
of direct perception, but of the application of a law to an individual
case. They recognise also, to a great extent, the same moral laws; but
differ as to their evidence, and the source from which they derive their
authority. According to the one opinion, the principles of morals are evident
a priori, requiring nothing to command assent, except that the meaning
of the terms be understood. According to the other doctrine, right and
wrong, as well as truth and falsehood, are questions of observation and
experience. But both hold equally that morality must be deduced from principles;
and the intuitive school affirm as strongly as the inductive, that there
is a science of morals....</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>On the present occasion, I shall,
without further discussion of the other theories, attempt to contribute
something towards the understanding and appreciation of the Utilitarian
or Happiness theory, and towards such proof as it is susceptible of. It
is evident that this cannot be proof in the ordinary and popular meaning
of the term. Questions of ultimate ends are not amenable to direct proof.
Whatever can be proved to be good, must be so by being shown to be a means
to something admitted to be good without proof. The medical art is proved
to be good by its conducing to health; but how is it possible to prove
that health is good? The art of music is good, for the reason, among others,
that it produces pleasure; but what proof is it possible to give that pleasure
is good? If, then, it is asserted that there is a comprehensive formula,
including all things which are in themselves good, and that whatever else
is good, is not so as an end, but as a mean, the formula may be accepted
or rejected, but is not a subject of what is commonly understood by proof.
We are not, however, to infer that its acceptance or rejection must depend
on blind impulse, or arbitrary choice. There is a larger meaning of the
word proof, in which this question is as amenable to it as any other of
the disputed questions of philosophy. The subject is within the cognisance
of the rational faculty; and neither does that faculty deal with it solely
in the way of intuition. Considerations may be presented capable of determining
the intellect either to give or withhold its assent to the doctrine; and
this is equivalent to proof.</font></font>

<p><b><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Chapter 2</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>What Utilitarianism Is.</font></font></b></center>
<b><font face="verdana"><font size=-1></font></font></b>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>.... The creed which accepts as the
foundation of morals, Utility, or the Greatest Happiness Principle, holds
that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness,
wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is
intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the
privation of pleasure. To give a clear view of the moral standard set up
by the theory, much more requires to be said; in particular, what things
it includes in the ideas of pain and pleasure; and to what extent this
is left an open question. But these supplementary explanations do not affect
the theory of life on which this theory of morality is grounded- namely,
that pleasure, and freedom from pain, are the only things desirable as
ends; and that all desirable things (which are as numerous in the utilitarian
as in any other scheme) are desirable either for the pleasure inherent
in themselves, or as means to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention
of pain.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Now, such a theory of life
excites in many minds, and among them in some of the most estimable in
feeling and purpose, inveterate dislike. To suppose that life has (as they
express it) no higher end than pleasure- no better and nobler object of
desire and pursuit- they designate as utterly mean and grovelling; as a
doctrine worthy only of swine, to whom the followers of Epicurus were,
at a very early period, contemptuously likened; and modern holders of the
doctrine are occasionally made the subject of equally polite comparisons
by its German, French, and English assailants.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>&nbsp;When thus attacked, the Epicureans
have always answered, that it is not they, but their accusers, who represent
human nature in a degrading light; since the accusation supposes human
beings to be capable of no pleasures except those of which swine are capable.
If this supposition were true, the charge could not be gainsaid, but would
then be no longer an imputation; for if the sources of pleasure were precisely
the same to human beings and to swine, the rule of life which is good enough
for the one would be good enough for the other. The comparison of the Epicurean
life to that of beasts is felt as degrading, precisely because a beast's
pleasures do not satisfy a human being's conceptions of happiness. Human
beings have faculties more elevated than the animal appetites, and when
once made conscious of them, do not regard anything as happiness which
does not include their gratification. I do not, indeed, consider the Epicureans
to have been by any means faultless in drawing out their scheme of consequences
from the utilitarian principle. To do this in any sufficient manner, many
Stoic, as well as Christian elements require to be included. But there
is no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the pleasures
of the intellect, of the feelings and imagination, and of the moral sentiments,
a much higher value as pleasures than to those of mere sensation. It must
be admitted, however, that utilitarian writers in general have placed the
superiority of mental over bodily pleasures chiefly in the greater permanency,
safety, uncostliness, etc., of the former- that is, in their circumstantial
advantages rather than in their intrinsic nature. And on all these points
utilitarians have fully proved their case; but they might have taken the
other, and, as it may be called, higher ground, with entire consistency.
It is quite compatible with the principle of utility to recognise the fact,
that some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.
It would be absurd that while, in estimating all other things, quality
is considered as well as quantity, the estimation of pleasures should be
supposed to depend on quantity alone.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>&nbsp;If I am asked, what I mean
by difference of quality in pleasures, or what makes one pleasure more
valuable than another, merely as a pleasure, except its being greater in
amount, there is but one possible answer. Of two pleasures, if there be
one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided
preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it,
that is the more desirable pleasure. If one of the two is, by those who
are competently acquainted with both, placed so far above the other that
they prefer it, even though knowing it to be attended with a greater amount
of discontent, and would not resign it for any quantity of the other pleasure
which their nature is capable of, we are justified in ascribing to the
preferred enjoyment a superiority in quality, so far outweighing quantity
as to render it, in comparison, of small account.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Now it is an unquestionable
fact that those who are equally acquainted with, and equally capable of
appreciating and enjoying, both, do give a most marked preference to the
manner of existence which employs their higher faculties. Few human creatures
would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals, for a promise
of the fullest allowance of a beast's pleasures; no intelligent human being
would consent to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus,
no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base, even though
they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is better
satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs. They would not resign
what they possess more than he for the most complete satisfaction of all
the desires which they have in common with him. If they ever fancy they
would, it is only in cases of unhappiness so extreme, that to escape from
it they would exchange their lot for almost any other, however undesirable
in their own eyes. A being of higher faculties requires more to make him
happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly accessible
to it at more points, than one of an inferior type; but in spite of these
liabilities, he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be
a lower grade of existence. We may give what explanation we please of this
unwillingness; we may attribute it to pride, a name which is given indiscriminately
to some of the most and to some of the least estimable feelings of which
mankind are capable: we may refer it to the love of liberty and personal
independence, an appeal to which was with the Stoics one of the most effective
means for the inculcation of it; to the love of power, or to the love of
excitement, both of which do really enter into and contribute to it: but
its most appropriate appellation is a sense of dignity, which all human
beings possess in one form or other, and in some, though by no means in
exact, proportion to their higher faculties, and which is so essential
a part of the happiness of those in whom it is strong, that nothing which
conflicts with it could be, otherwise than momentarily, an object of desire
to them.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>....From this verdict of the only
competent judges, I apprehend there can be no appeal. On a question which
is the best worth having of two pleasures, or which of two modes of existence
is the most grateful to the feelings, apart from its moral attributes and
from its consequences, the judgment of those who are qualified by knowledge
of both, or, if they differ, that of the majority among them, must be admitted
as final. And there needs be the less hesitation to accept this judgment
respecting the quality of pleasures, since there is no other tribunal to
be referred to even on the question of quantity. What means are there of
determining which is the acutest of two pains, or the intensest of two
pleasurable sensations, except the general suffrage of those who are familiar
with both? Neither pains nor pleasures are homogeneous, and pain is always
heterogeneous with pleasure. What is there to decide whether a particular
pleasure is worth purchasing at the cost of a particular pain, except the
feelings and judgment of the experienced? When, therefore, those feelings
and judgment declare the pleasures derived from the higher faculties to
be preferable in kind, apart from the question of intensity, to those of
which the animal nature, disjoined from the higher faculties, is suspectible,
they are entitled on this subject to the same regard.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>....I must again repeat, what the
assailants of utilitarianism seldom have the justice to acknowledge, that
the happiness which forms the utilitarian standard of what is right in
conduct, is not the agent's own happiness, but that of all concerned. As
between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him
to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator.
In the golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth, we read the complete spirit of
the ethics of utility. To do as you would be done by, and to love your
neighbour as yourself, constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality.
As the means of making the nearest approach to this ideal, utility would
enjoin, first, that laws and social arrangements should place the happiness,
or (as speaking practically it may be called) the interest, of every individual,
as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the whole; and secondly,
that education and opinion, which have so vast a power over human character,
should so use that power as to establish in the mind of every individual
an indissoluble association between his own happiness and the good of the
whole; especially between his own happiness and the practice of such modes
of conduct, negative and positive, as regard for the universal happiness
prescribes; so that not only he may be unable to conceive the possibility
of happiness to himself, consistently with conduct opposed to the general
good, but also that a direct impulse to promote the general good may be
in every individual one of the habitual motives of action, and the sentiments
connected therewith may fill a large and prominent place in every human
being's sentient existence. If the, impugners of the utilitarian morality
represented it to their own minds in this its, true character, I know not
what recommendation possessed by any other morality they could possibly
affirm to be wanting to it; what more beautiful or more exalted developments
of human nature any other ethical system can be supposed to foster, or
what springs of action, not accessible to the utilitarian, such systems
rely on for giving effect to their mandates.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>&nbsp;The objectors to utilitarianism
cannot always be charged with representing it in a discreditable light.
On the contrary, those among them who entertain anything like a just idea
of its disinterested character, sometimes find fault with its standard
as being too high for humanity. They say it is exacting too much to require
that people shall always act from the inducement of promoting the general
interests of society. But this is to mistake the very meaning of a standard
of morals, and confound the rule of action with the motive of it. It is
the business of ethics to tell us what are our duties, or by what test
we may know them; but no system of ethics requires that the sole motive
of all we do shall be a feeling of duty; on the contrary, ninety-nine hundredths
of all our actions are done from other motives, and rightly so done, if
the rule of duty does not condemn them. It is the more unjust to utilitarianism
that this particular misapprehension should be made a ground of objection
to it, inasmuch as utilitarian moralists have gone beyond almost all others
in affirming that the motive has nothing to do with the morality of the
action, though much with the worth of the agent. He who saves a fellow
creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be
duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble; he who betrays the friend
that trusts him, is guilty of a crime, even if his object be to serve another
friend to whom he is under greater obligations.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>But to speak only of actions done
from the motive of duty, and in direct obedience to principle: it is a
misapprehension of the utilitarian mode of thought, to conceive it as implying
that people should fix their minds upon so wide a generality as the world,
or society at large. The great majority of good actions are intended not
for the benefit of the world, but for that of individuals, of which the
good of the world is made up; and the thoughts of the most virtuous man
need not on these occasions travel beyond the particular persons concerned,
except so far as is necessary to assure himself that in benefiting them
he is not violating the rights, that is, the legitimate and authorised
expectations, of any one else. The multiplication of happiness is, according
to the utilitarian ethics, the object of virtue: the occasions on which
any person (except one in a thousand) has it in his power to do this on
an extended scale, in other words to be a public benefactor, are but exceptional;
and on these occasions alone is he called on to consider public utility;
in every other case, private utility, the interest or happiness of some
few persons, is all he has to attend to. Those alone the influence of whose
actions extends to society in general, need concern themselves habitually
about large an object. In the case of abstinences indeed- of things which
people forbear to do from moral considerations, though the consequences
in the particular case might be beneficial- it would be unworthy of an
intelligent agent not to be consciously aware that the action is of a class
which, if practised generally, would be generally injurious, and that this
is the ground of the obligation to abstain from it. The amount of regard
for the public interest implied in this recognition, is no greater than
is demanded by every system of morals, for they all enjoin to abstain from
whatever is manifestly pernicious to society.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>The same considerations dispose of
another reproach against the doctrine of utility, founded on a still grosser
misconception of the purpose of a standard of morality, and of the very
meaning of the words right and wrong. It is often affirmed that utilitarianism
renders men cold and unsympathising; that it chills their moral feelings
towards individuals; that it makes them regard only the dry and hard consideration
of the consequences of actions, not taking into their moral estimate the
qualities from which those actions emanate. If the assertion means that
they do not allow their judgment respecting the rightness or wrongness
of an action to be influenced by their opinion of the qualities of the
person who does it, this is a complaint not against utilitarianism, but
against having any standard of morality at all; for certainly no known
ethical standard decides an action to be good or bad because it is done
by a good or a bad man, still less because done by an amiable, a brave,
or a benevolent man, or the contrary. These considerations are relevant,
not to the estimation of actions, but of persons; and there is nothing
in the utilitarian theory inconsistent with the fact that there are other
things which interest us in persons besides the rightness and wrongness
of their actions. The Stoics, indeed, with the paradoxical misuse of language
which was part of their system, and by which they strove to raise themselves
above all concern about anything but virtue, were fond of saying that he
who has that has everything; that he, and only he, is rich, is beautiful,
is a king. But no claim of this description is made for the virtuous man
by the utilitarian doctrine. Utilitarians are quite aware that there are
other desirable possessions and qualities besides virtue, and are perfectly
willing to allow to all of them their full worth. They are also aware that
a right action does not necessarily indicate a virtuous character, and
that actions which are blamable, often proceed from qualities entitled
to praise. When this is apparent in any particular case, it modifies their
estimation, not certainly of the act, but of the agent. I grant that they
are, notwithstanding, of opinion, that in the long run the best proof of
a good character is good actions; and resolutely refuse to consider any
mental disposition as good, of which the predominant tendency is to produce
bad conduct. This makes them unpopular with many people; but it is an unpopularity
which they must share with every one who regards the distinction between
right and wrong in a serious light; and the reproach is not one which a
conscientious utilitarian need be anxious to repel.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>If no more be meant by the objection
than that many utilitarians look on the morality of actions, as measured
by the utilitarian standard, with too exclusive a regard, and do not lay
sufficient stress upon the other beauties of character which go towards
making a human being lovable or admirable, this may be admitted. Utilitarians
who have cultivated their moral feelings, but not their sympathies nor
their artistic perceptions, do fall into this mistake; and so do all other
moralists under the same conditions. What can be said in excuse for other
moralists is equally available for them, namely, that, if there is to be
any error, it is better that it should be on that side. As a matter of
fact, we may affirm that among utilitarians as among adherents of other
systems, there is every imaginable degree of rigidity and of laxity in
the application of their standard: some are even puritanically rigorous,
while others are as indulgent as can possibly be desired by sinner or by
sentimentalist. But on the whole, a doctrine which brings prominently forward
the interest that mankind have in the repression and prevention of conduct
which violates the moral law, is likely to be inferior to no other in turning
the sanctions of opinion again such violations. It is true, the question,
What does violate the moral law? is one on which those who recognise different
standards of morality are likely now and then to differ. But difference
of opinion on moral questions was not first introduced into the world by
utilitarianism, while that doctrine does supply, if not always an easy,
at all events a tangible and intelligible mode of deciding such differences.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>&nbsp;....But to consider the rules
of morality as improvable, is one thing; to pass over the intermediate
generalisations entirely, and endeavour to test each individual action
directly by the first principle, is another. It is a strange notion that
the acknowledgment of a first principle is inconsistent with the admission
of secondary ones. To inform a traveller respecting the place of his. ultimate
destination, is not to forbid the use of landmarks and direction-posts
on the way. The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality,
does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal, or that
persons going thither should not be advised to take one direction rather
than another. Men really ought to leave off talking a kind of nonsense
on this subject, which they would neither talk nor listen to on other matters
of practical concernment. Nobody argues that the art of navigation is not
founded on astronomy, because sailors cannot wait to calculate the Nautical
Almanack. Being rational creatures, they go to sea with it ready calculated;
and all rational creatures go out upon the sea of life with their minds
made up on the common questions of right and wrong, as well as on many
of the far more difficult questions of wise and foolish. And this, as long
as foresight is a human quality, it is to be presumed they will continue
to do. Whatever we adopt as the fundamental principle of morality, we require
subordinate principles to apply it by; the impossibility of doing without
them, being common to all systems, can afford no argument against any one
in particular; but gravely to argue as if no such secondary principles
could be had, and as if mankind had remained till now, and always must
remain, without drawing any general conclusions from the experience of
human life, is as high a pitch, I think, as absurdity has ever reached
in philosophical controversy.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>The remainder of the stock arguments
against utilitarianism mostly consist in laying to its charge the common
infirmities of human nature, and the general difficulties which embarrass
conscientious persons in shaping their course through life. We are told
that a utilitarian will be apt to make his own particular case an exception
to moral rules, and, when under temptation, will see a utility in the breach
of a rule, greater than he will see in its observance. But is utility the
only creed which is able to furnish us with excuses for evil doing, and
means of cheating our own conscience? They are afforded in abundance by
all doctrines which recognise as a fact in morals the existence of conflicting
considerations; which all doctrines do, that have been believed by sane
persons. It is not the fault of any creed, but of the complicated nature
of human affairs, that rules of conduct cannot be so framed as to require
no exceptions, and that hardly any kind of action can safely be laid down
as either always obligatory or always condemnable. There is no ethical
creed which does not temper the rigidity of its laws, by giving a certain
latitude, under the moral responsibility of the agent, for accommodation
to peculiarities of circumstances; and under every creed, at the opening
thus made, self-deception and dishonest casuistry get in. There exists
no moral system under which there do not arise unequivocal cases of conflicting
obligation. These are the real difficulties, the knotty points both in
the theory of ethics, and in the conscientious guidance of personal conduct.
They are overcome practically, with greater or with less success, according
to the intellect and virtue of the individual; but it can hardly be pretended
that any one will be the less qualified for dealing with them, from possessing
an ultimate standard to which conflicting rights and duties can be referred.
If utility is the ultimate source of moral obligations, utility may be
invoked to decide between them when their demands are incompatible. Though
the application of the standard may be difficult, it is better than none
at all: while in other systems, the moral laws all claiming independent
authority, there is no common umpire entitled to interfere between them;
their claims to precedence one over another rest on little better than
sophistry, and unless determined, as they generally are, by the unacknowledged
influence of considerations of utility, afford a free scope for the action
of personal desires and partialities. We must remember that only in these
cases of conflict between secondary principles is it requisite that first
principles should be appealed to. There is no case of moral obligation
in which some secondary principle is not involved; and if only one, there
can seldom be any real doubt which one it is, in the mind of any person
by whom the principle itself is recognised.</font></font>

<br><b><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>Of what sort of Proof the Principle
of Utility is Susceptible.</font></font></b></center>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>IT HAS already been remarked,
that questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof, in the ordinary
acceptation of the term. To be incapable of proof by reasoning is common
to all first principles; to the first premises of our knowledge, as well
as to those of our conduct. But the former, being matters of fact, may
be the subject of a direct appeal to the faculties which judge of fact-
namely, our senses, and our internal consciousness. Can an appeal be made
to the same faculties on questions of practical ends? Or by what other
faculty is cognisance taken of them?</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>Questions about ends are, in other
words, questions what things are desirable. The utilitarian doctrine is,
that happiness is desirable, and the only thing desirable, as an end; all
other things being only desirable as means to that end. What ought to be
required of this doctrine- what conditions is it requisite that the doctrine
should fulfil- to make good its claim to be believed?</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>The only proof capable of being given
that an object is visible, is that people actually see it. The only proof
that a sound is audible, is that people hear it: and so of the other sources
of our experience. In like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is
possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually
desire it. If the end which the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself
were not, in theory and in practice, acknowledged to be an end, nothing
could ever convince any person that it was so. No reason can be given why
the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as
he believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness. This, however,
being a fact, we have not only all the proof which the case admits of,
but all which it is possible to require, that happiness is a good: that
each person's happiness is a good to that person, and the general happiness,
therefore, a good to the aggregate of all persons. Happiness has made out
its title as one of the ends of conduct, and consequently one of the criteria
of morality.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>But it has not, by this alone, proved
itself to be the sole criterion. To do that, it would seem, by the same
rule, necessary to show, not only that people desire happiness, but that
they never desire anything else. Now it is palpable that they do desire
things which, in common language, are decidedly distinguished from happiness.
They desire, for example, virtue, and the absence of vice, no less really
than pleasure and the absence of pain. The desire of virtue is not as universal,
but it is as authentic a fact, as the desire of happiness. And hence the
opponents of the utilitarian standard deem that they have a right to infer
that there are other ends of human action besides happiness, and that happiness
is not the standard of approbation and disapprobation.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>But does the utilitarian doctrine
deny that people desire virtue, or maintain that virtue is not a thing
to be desired? The very reverse. It maintains not only that virtue is to
be desired, but that it is to be desired disinterestedly, for itself. Whatever
may be the opinion of utilitarian moralists as to the original conditions
by which virtue is made virtue; however they may believe (as they do) that
actions and dispositions are only virtuous because they promote another
end than virtue; yet this being granted, and it having been decided, from
considerations of this description, what is virtuous, they not only place
virtue at the very head of the things which are good as means to the ultimate
end, but they also recognise as a psychological fact the possibility of
its being, to the individual, a good in itself, without looking to any
end beyond it; and hold, that the mind is not in a right state, not in
a state conformable to Utility, not in the state most conducive to the
general happiness, unless it does love virtue in this manner- as a thing
desirable in itself, even although, in the individual instance, it should
not produce those other desirable consequences which it tends to produce,
and on account of which it is held to be virtue. This opinion is not, in
the smallest degree, a departure from the Happiness principle. The ingredients
of happiness are very various, and each of them is desirable in itself,
and not merely when considered as swelling an aggregate. The principle
of utility does not mean that any given pleasure, as music, for instance,
or any given exemption from pain, as for example health, is to be looked
upon as means to a collective something termed happiness, and to be desired
on that account. They are desired and desirable in and for themselves;
besides being means, they are a part of the end. Virtue, according to the
utilitarian doctrine, is not naturally and originally part of the end,
but it is capable of becoming so; and in those who love it disinterestedly
it has become so, and is desired and cherished, not as a means to happiness,
but as a part of their happiness.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>To illustrate this farther, we may
remember that virtue is not the only thing, originally a means, and which
if it were not a means to anything else, would be and remain indifferent,
but which by association with what it is a means to, comes to be desired
for itself, and that too with the utmost intensity. What, for example,
shall we say of the love of money? There is nothing originally more desirable
about money than about any heap of glittering pebbles. Its worth is solely
that of the things which it will buy; the desires for other things than
itself, which it is a means of gratifying. Yet the love of money is not
only one of the strongest moving forces of human life, but money is, in
many cases, desired in and for itself; the desire to possess it is often
stronger than the desire to use it, and goes on increasing when all the
desires which point to ends beyond it, to be compassed by it, are falling
off. It may, then, be said truly, that money is desired not for the sake
of an end, but as part of the end. From being a means to happiness, it
has come to be itself a principal ingredient of the individual's conception
of happiness. The same may be said of the majority of the great objects
of human life- power, for example, or fame; except that to each of these
there is a certain amount of immediate pleasure annexed, which has at least
the semblance of being naturally inherent in them; a thing which cannot
be said of money. Still, however, the strongest natural attraction, both
of power and of fame, is the immense aid they give to the attainment of
our other wishes; and it is the strong association thus generated between
them and all our objects of desire, which gives to the direct desire of
them the intensity it often assumes, so as in some characters to surpass
in strength all other desires. In these cases the means have become a part
of the end, and a more important part of it than any of the things which
they are means to. What was once desired as an instrument for the attainment
of happiness, has come to be desired for its own sake. In being desired
for its own sake it is, however, desired as part of happiness. The person
is made, or thinks he would be made, happy by its mere possession; and
is made unhappy by failure to obtain it. The desire of it is not a different
thing from the desire of happiness, any more than the love of music, or
the desire of health. They are included in happiness. They are some of
the elements of which the desire of happiness is made up. Happiness is
not an abstract idea, but a concrete whole; and these are some of its parts.
And the utilitarian standard sanctions and approves their being so. Life
would be a poor thing, very ill provided with sources of happiness, if
there were not this provision of nature, by which things originally indifferent,
but conducive to, or otherwise associated with, the satisfaction of our
primitive desires, become in themselves sources of pleasure more valuable
than the primitive pleasures, both in permanency, in the space of human
existence that they are capable of covering, and even in intensity.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>Virtue, according to the utilitarian
conception, is a good of this description. There was no original desire
of it, or motive to it, save its conduciveness to pleasure, and especially
to protection from pain. But through the association thus formed, it may
be felt a good in itself, and desired as such with as great intensity as
any other good; and with this difference between it and the love of money,
of power, or of fame, that all of these may, and often do, render the individual
noxious to the other members of the society to which he belongs, whereas
there is nothing which makes him so much a blessing to them as the cultivation
of the disinterested love of virtue. And consequently, the utilitarian
standard, while it tolerates and approves those other acquired desires,
up to the point beyond which they would be more injurious to the general
happiness than promotive of it, enjoins and requires the cultivation of
the love of virtue up to the greatest strength possible, as being above
all things important to the general happiness.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>It results from the preceding considerations,
that there is in reality nothing desired except happiness. Whatever is
desired otherwise than as a means to some end beyond itself, and ultimately
to happiness, is desired as itself a part of happiness, and is not desired
for itself until it has become so. Those who desire virtue for its own
sake, desire it either because the consciousness of it is a pleasure, or
because the consciousness of being without it is a pain, or for both reasons
united; as in truth the pleasure and pain seldom exist separately, but
almost always together, the same person feeling pleasure in the degree
of virtue attained, and pain in not having attained more. If one of these
gave him no pleasure, and the other no pain, he would not love or desire
virtue, or would desire it only for the other benefits which it might produce
to himself or to persons whom he cared for. We have now, then, an answer
to the question, of what sort of proof the principle of utility is susceptible.
If the opinion which I have now stated is psychologically true- if human
nature is so constituted as to desire nothing which is not either a part
of happiness or a means of happiness, we can have no other proof, and we
require no other, that these are the only things desirable. If so, happiness
is the sole end of human action, and the promotion of it the test by which
to judge of all human conduct; from whence it necessarily follows that
it must be the criterion of morality, since a part is included in the whole.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>And now to decide whether this is
really so; whether mankind do desire nothing for itself but that which
is a pleasure to them, or of which the absence is a pain; we have evidently
arrived at a question of fact and experience, dependent, like all similar
questions, upon evidence. It can only be determined by practised self-consciousness
and self-observation, assisted by observation of others. I believe that
these sources of evidence, impartially consulted, will declare that desiring
a thing and finding it pleasant, aversion to it and thinking of it as painful,
are phenomena entirely inseparable, or rather two parts of the same phenomenon;
in strictness of language, two different modes of naming the same psychological
fact: that to think of an object as desirable (unless for the sake of its
consequences), and to think of it as pleasant, are one and the same thing;
and that to desire anything, except in proportion as the idea of it is
pleasant, is a physical and metaphysical impossibility.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>So obvious does this appear to me,
that I expect it will hardly be disputed: and the objection made will be,
not that desire can possibly be directed to anything ultimately except
pleasure and exemption from pain, but that the will is a different thing
from desire; that a person of confirmed virtue, or any other person whose
purposes are fixed, carries out his purposes without any thought of the
pleasure he has in contemplating them, or expects to derive from their
fulfilment; and persists in acting on them, even though these pleasures
are much diminished, by changes in his character or decay of his passive
sensibilities, or are outweighed by the pains which the pursuit of the
purposes may bring upon him. All this I fully admit, and have stated it
elsewhere, as positively and emphatically as any one. Will, the active
phenomenon, is a different thing from desire, the state of passive sensibility,
and though originally an offshoot from it, may in time take root and detach
itself from the parent stock; so much so, that in the case of an habitual
purpose, instead of willing the thing because we desire it, we often desire
it only because we will it. This, however, is but an instance of that familiar
fact, the power of habit, and is nowise confined to the case of virtuous
actions. Many indifferent things, which men originally did from a motive
of some sort, they continue to do from habit. Sometimes this is done unconsciously,
the consciousness coming only after the action: at other times with conscious
volition, but volition which has become habitual, and is put in operation
by the force of habit, in opposition perhaps to the deliberate preference,
as often happens with those who have contracted habits of vicious or hurtful
indulgence.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>Third and last comes the case in
which the habitual act of will in the individual instance is not in contradiction
to the general intention prevailing at other times, but in fulfilment of
it; as in the case of the person of confirmed virtue, and of all who pursue
deliberately and consistently any determinate end. The distinction between
will and desire thus understood is an authentic and highly important psychological
fact; but the fact consists solely in this- that will, like all other parts
of our constitution, is amenable to habit, and that we may will from habit
what we no longer desire for itself or desire only because we will it.
It is not the less true that will, in the beginning, is entirely produced
by desire; including in that term the repelling influence of pain as well
as the attractive one of pleasure. Let us take into consideration, no longer
the person who has a confirmed will to do right, but him in whom that virtuous
will is still feeble, conquerable by temptation, and not to be fully relied
on; by what means can it be strengthened? How can the will to be virtuous,
where it does not exist in sufficient force, be implanted or awakened?
Only by making the person desire virtue- by making him think of it in a
pleasurable light, or of its absence in a painful one. It is by associating
the doing right with pleasure, or the doing wrong with pain, or by eliciting
and impressing and bringing home to the person's experience the pleasure
naturally involved in the one or the pain in the other, that it is possible
to call forth that will to be virtuous, which, when confirmed, acts without
any thought of either pleasure or pain. Will is the child of desire, and
passes out of the dominion of its parent only to come under that of habit.
That which is the result of habit affords no presumption of being intrinsically
good; and there would be no reason for wishing that the purpose of virtue
should become independent of pleasure and pain, were it not that the influence
of the pleasurable and painful associations which prompt to virtue is not
sufficiently to be depended on for unerring constancy of action until it
has acquired the support of habit. Both in feeling and in conduct, habit
is the only thing which imparts certainty; and it is because of the importance
to others of being able to rely absolutely on one's feelings and conduct,
and to oneself of being able to rely on one's own, that the will to do
right ought to be cultivated into this habitual independence. In other
words, this state of the will is a means to good, not intrinsically a good;
and does not contradict the doctrine that nothing is a good to human beings
but in so far as it is either itself pleasurable, or a means of attaining
pleasure or averting pain.</font></font>
<p><font face="verdana"><font size=-1>But if this doctrine be true, the
principle of utility is proved. Whether it is so or not, must now be left
to the consideration of the thoughtful reader.</font></font>
