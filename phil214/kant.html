<p align="center">FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE METAPHYSIC OF MORALS</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;by Immanuel Kant</p>
<p align="center">translated by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott</p>
<p>PREFACE
<p>&nbsp;&#8230;Everyone must admit that if a law is to have moral force, i.e., to be
the basis of an obligation, it must carry with it absolute necessity; that,
for example, the precept, "Thou shalt not lie," is not valid for men alone,
as if other rational beings had no need to observe it; and so with all
the other moral laws properly so called; that, therefore, the basis of
obligation must not be sought in the nature of man, or in the circumstances
in the world in which he is placed, but a priori simply in the conception
of pure reason; and although any other precept which is founded on principles
of mere experience may be in certain respects universal, yet in as far
as it rests even in the least degree on an empirical basis, perhaps only
as to a motive, such a precept, while it may be a practical rule, can never
be called a moral law.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>FIRST SECTION: TRANSITION FROM THE
COMMON RATIONAL KNOWLEDGE&nbsp; OF MORALITY TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp; Nothing can possibly be conceived in the world, or even out of
it, which can be called good, without qualification, except a good will.&nbsp;
Intelligence, wit, judgement, and the other talents of the mind, however
they may be named, or courage, resolution, perseverance, as qualities of
temperament, are undoubtedly good and desirable in many respects; but these
gifts of nature may also become extremely bad and mischievous if the will
which is to make use of them, and which, therefore, constitutes what is
called character, is not good. It is the same with the gifts of fortune.
Power, riches, honour, even health, and the general well-being and contentment
with one's condition which is called happiness, inspire pride, and often
presumption, if there is not a good will to correct the influence of these
on the mind, and with this also to rectify the whole principle of acting
and adapt it to its end. The sight of a being who is not adorned with a
single feature of a pure and good will, enjoying unbroken prosperity, can
never give pleasure to an impartial rational spectator. Thus a good will
appears to constitute the indispensable condition even of being worthy
of happiness.
<p>&nbsp; &#8230;Now an action done from duty must wholly exclude the influence
of inclination and with it every object of the will, so that nothing remains
which can determine the will except objectively the law, and subjectively
pure respect for this practical law, and consequently the maxim* that I
should follow this law even to the thwarting of all my inclinations.
<p>&nbsp; *A maxim is the subjective principle of volition. The objective
principle (i.e., that which would also serve subjectively as a
<br>practical principle to all rational beings if reason had full power
over the faculty of desire) is the practical law.
<p>&nbsp; Thus the moral worth of an action does not lie in the effect
expected from it, nor in any principle of action which requires to
<br>borrow its motive from this expected effect. For all these effects-
agreeableness of one's condition and even the promotion of the happiness
of others- could have been also brought about by other causes, so that
for this there would have been no need of the will of a rational being;
whereas it is in this alone that the supreme and unconditional good can
be found. The pre-eminent good which we call moral can therefore consist
in nothing else than the conception of law in itself, which certainly is
only possible in a rational being, in so far as this conception, and not
the expected effect, determines the will&#8230;
<p>&nbsp; SECOND SECTION
<p>&nbsp; &#8230;.Now all imperatives command either hypothetically or categorically.
The former represent the practical necessity of a
<br>possible action as means to something else that is willed (or at least
which one might possibly will). The categorical imperative would be that
which represented an action as necessary of itself without reference to
another end, i.e., as objectively necessary.
<br>&nbsp; Since every practical law represents a possible action as good
and, on this account, for a subject who is practically determinable by
reason, necessary, all imperatives are formulae determining an action which
is necessary according to the principle of a will good in some respects.
If now the action is good only as a means to something else, then the imperative
is hypothetical; if it is conceived as good in itself and consequently
as being necessarily the principle of a will which of itself conforms to
reason, then it is categorical.
<p>&nbsp;Thus the imperative declares what action possible by me would
be good and presents the practical rule in relation to a will which does
not forthwith perform an action simply because it is good, whether because
the subject does not always know that it is good, or because, even if it
know this, yet its maxims might be opposed to the objective principles
of practical reason.
<p>&nbsp; Accordingly the hypothetical imperative only says that the action
is good for some purpose, possible or actual. In the first case it is a
problematical, in the second an assertorial practical principle. The categorical
imperative which declares an action to be objectively necessary in itself
without reference to any purpose, i.e., without any other end, is valid
as an apodeictic (practical) principle.
<p>&nbsp; Whatever is possible only by the power of some rational being
may also be conceived as a possible purpose of some will; and therefore
the principles of action as regards the means necessary to attain some
possible purpose are in fact infinitely numerous. All sciences have a practical
part, consisting of problems expressing that some end is possible for us
and of imperatives directing how it may be attained. These may, therefore,
be called in general imperatives of skill.&nbsp; Here there is no question
whether the end is rational and good, but only what one must do in order
to attain it. The precepts for the physician to make his patient thoroughly
healthy, and for a poisoner to ensure certain death, are of equal value
in this respect, that each serves to effect its purpose perfectly. Since
in early youth it cannot be known what ends are likely to occur to us in
the course of life, parents seek to have their children taught a great many things, and
provide for their skill in the use of means for all sorts of arbitrary
ends, of none of which can they determine whether it may not perhaps hereafter
be an object to their pupil, but which it is at all events possible that
he might aim at; and this anxiety is so great that they commonly neglect
to form and correct their judgement on the value of the things which may
be chosen as ends.
<p>&nbsp; There is one end, however, which may be assumed to be actually
such to all rational beings (so far as imperatives apply to them, viz.,
as dependent beings), and, therefore, one purpose which they not merely
may have, but which we may with certainty assume that they all actually
have by a natural necessity, and this is happiness&#8230;
<p>&nbsp; &#8230;In this problem we will first inquire whether the mere conception
of a categorical imperative may not perhaps supply us also with the formula
of it, containing the proposition which alone can be a categorical imperative;
for even if we know the tenor of such an absolute command, yet how it is
possible will require further special and laborious study, which we postpone
to the last section.
<br>&nbsp; When I conceive a hypothetical imperative, in general I do not
know beforehand what it will contain until I am given the condition. But
when I conceive a categorical imperative, I know at once what it contains.
For as the imperative contains besides the law only the necessity that
the maxims* shall conform to this law, while the law contains no conditions
restricting it, there remains nothing but the general statement that the
maxim of the action should conform to a universal law, and it is this conformity
alone that the imperative properly represents as necessary.
<p>&nbsp; *A maxim is a subjective principle of action, and must be distinguished
from the objective principle, namely, practical law. The former contains the practical rule set by reason according to the conditions
of the subject (often its ignorance or its inclinations), so that it is the principle on which the subject acts; but the law
is the objective principle valid for every rational being, and is the principle on which it ought to act that is an imperative.
<p>&nbsp; There is therefore but one categorical imperative, namely,
this: <i>Act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will
that it should become a universal law.</i>
<p>&nbsp; Now if all imperatives of duty can be deduced from this one imperative
as from their principle, then, although it should remain
<br>undecided what is called duty is not merely a vain notion, yet at least
we shall be able to show what we understand by it and what this notion
means.
<p>&nbsp; Since the universality of the law according to which effects
are produced constitutes what is properly called nature in the most general sense (as to form), that is the existence of things so far
as it is determined by general laws, the imperative of duty may be expressed
thus: Act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by thy will a universal
law of nature.
<p>&nbsp; We will now enumerate a few duties, adopting the usual division
of them into duties to ourselves and ourselves and to others, and into
perfect and imperfect duties.
<p>&nbsp; 1. A man reduced to despair by a series of misfortunes feels
wearied of life, but is still so far in possession of his reason that he
can ask himself whether it would not be contrary to his duty to himself
to take his own life. Now he inquires whether the maxim of his action could
become a universal law of nature. His maxim is: "From self-love I adopt
it as a principle to shorten my life when its longer duration is likely
to bring more evil than satisfaction." It is asked then simply whether
this principle founded on self-love can become a universal law of nature.
Now we see at once that a system of nature of which it should be a law
to destroy life by means of the very feeling whose special nature it is
to impel to the improvement of life would contradict itself and, therefore,
could not exist as a system of nature; hence that maxim cannot possibly
exist as a universal law of nature and, consequently, would be wholly inconsistent
with the supreme principle of all duty.
<p>&nbsp; 2. Another finds himself forced by necessity to borrow money.
He knows that he will not be able to repay it, but sees also that nothing
will be lent to him unless he promises stoutly to repay it in a definite
time. He desires to make this promise, but he has still so much conscience
as to ask himself: "Is it not unlawful and inconsistent with duty to get
out of a difficulty in this way?"
<br>Suppose however that he resolves to do so: then the maxim of his action
would be expressed thus: "When I think myself in want of money, I will
borrow money and promise to repay it, although I know that I never can
do so." Now this principle of self-love or of one's own advantage may perhaps
be consistent with my whole future welfare; but the question now is, "Is
it right?" I change then the suggestion of self-love into a universal law,
and state the question thus: "How would it be if my maxim were a universal
law?" Then I see at once that it could never hold as a universal law of
nature, but would necessarily contradict itself. For supposing it to be
a universal law that everyone when he thinks himself in a difficulty should
be able to promise whatever he pleases, with the purpose of not keeping
his promise, the promise itself would become impossible, as well as the
end that one might have in view in it, since no one would consider that
anything was promised to him, but would ridicule all such
<br>statements as vain pretences.
<p>&nbsp; 3. A third finds in himself a talent which with the help of some
culture might make him a useful man in many respects. But he finds himself
in comfortable circumstances and prefers to indulge in pleasure rather
than to take pains in enlarging and improving his happy natural capacities.
He asks, however, whether his maxim of neglect of his natural gifts, besides
agreeing with his inclination to indulgence, agrees also with what is called
duty. He sees then that a system of nature could indeed subsist with such
a universal law although men (like the South Sea islanders) should let
their talents rest and resolve to devote their lives merely to idleness,
amusement, and propagation of their species- in a word, to enjoyment; but
he cannot possibly will that this should be a universal law of nature,
or be implanted in us as such by a natural instinct.&nbsp; For, as a rational
being, he necessarily wills that his faculties be developed, since they
serve him and have been given him, for all sorts of possible purposes.
<p>&nbsp; 4. A fourth, who is in prosperity, while he sees that others
have to contend with great wretchedness and that he could help them, thinks:
"What concern is it of mine? Let everyone be as happy as Heaven pleases,
or as be can make himself; I will take nothing from him nor even envy him,
only I do not wish to contribute anything to his welfare or to his assistance
in distress!" Now no doubt if such a mode of thinking were a universal
law, the human race might very well subsist and doubtless even better than
in a state in which everyone talks of sympathy and good-will, or even takes
care occasionally to
<br>put it into practice, but, on the other side, also cheats when he can,
betrays the rights of men, or otherwise violates them. But although it
is possible that a universal law of nature might exist in accordance with
that maxim, it is impossible to will that such a principle should have
the universal validity of a law of nature. For a will which resolved this
would contradict itself, inasmuch as many cases might occur in which one
would have need of the love and sympathy of others, and in which, by such
a law of nature, sprung from his own will, he would deprive himself of
all hope of the aid he desires.
<p>&nbsp; These are a few of the many actual duties, or at least what we
regard as such, which obviously fall into two classes on the one
<br>principle that we have laid down. We must be able to will that a maxim
of our action should be a universal law. This is the canon of the moral
appreciation of the action generally. Some actions are of such a character
that their maxim cannot without contradiction be even conceived as a universal
law of nature, far from it being possible that we should will that it should
be so. In others this intrinsic impossibility is not found, but still it
is impossible to will that their maxim should be raised to the universality
of a law of nature, since such a will would contradict itself It is easily
seen that the former violate strict or rigorous (inflexible) duty; the
latter only laxer (meritorious) duty. Thus it has been completely shown
how all duties depend as regards the nature of the obligation (not the
object of the action) on the same principle.
<p>&nbsp; If now we attend to ourselves on occasion of any transgression
of duty, we shall find that we in fact do not will that our maxim should be a universal law, for that is impossible for us; on the contrary,
we will that the opposite should remain a universal law, only we assume the liberty of making an exception in our own favour
or (just for this time only) in favour of our inclination. Consequently
if we considered all cases from one and the same point of view, namely,
that of reason, we should find a contradiction in our own will, namely,
that a certain principle should be objectively necessary as a universal
law, and yet subjectively should not be universal, but admit of exceptions.
As however we at one moment regard our action from the point of view of
a will wholly conformed to reason, and then again look at the same action
from the point of view of a will
<br>affected by inclination, there is not really any contradiction, but
an antagonism of inclination to the precept of reason, whereby the universality
of the principle is changed into a mere generality, so that the practical
principle of reason shall meet the maxim half way. Now, although this cannot
be justified in our own impartial judgement, yet it proves that we do really
recognise the validity of the categorical imperative and (with all respect
for it) only allow ourselves a few exceptions, which we think unimportant
and forced from us.
<p>&nbsp; We have thus established at least this much, that if duty is
a conception which is to have any import and real legislative
<br>authority for our actions, it can only be expressed in categorical
and not at all in hypothetical imperatives. We have also, which is of great
importance, exhibited clearly and definitely for every practical application
the content of the categorical imperative, which must contain the principle
of all duty if there is such a thing at all.
<p>We have not yet, however, advanced so far as to prove a priori that
there actually is such an imperative, that there is a practical law which
commands absolutely of itself and without any other impulse, and that the
following of this law is duty&#8230;
<p>&nbsp; &#8230;Now I say: man and generally any rational being exists as an
end in himself, not merely as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or
that will, but in all his actions, whether they concern himself or other
rational beings, must be always regarded at the same time as an end. All
objects of the inclinations have only a conditional worth, for if the inclinations
and the wants founded on them did not exist, then their object would be
without value. But the inclinations, themselves being sources of want,
are so far from having an absolute worth for which they should be desired
that on the contrary it must be the universal wish of every rational being
to be wholly free from them. Thus the worth of any object which is to be
acquired by our action is always conditional. Beings whose existence depends
not on our will but on nature's, have nevertheless, if they are irrational
beings, only a relative value as means, and are therefore called things;
rational beings, on the contrary, are called persons,&nbsp; because their
very nature points them out as ends in themselves, that is as something
which must not be used merely as means, and so
<br>far therefore restricts freedom of action (and is an object of respect).
These, therefore, are not merely subjective ends whose
<br>existence has a worth for us as an effect of our action, but objective
ends, that is, things whose existence is an end in itself; an end moreover
for which no other can be substituted, which they should subserve merely
as means, for otherwise nothing whatever would possess absolute worth;
but if all worth were conditioned and therefore contingent, then there
would be no supreme practical principle of reason whatever.
<p>&nbsp; If then there is a supreme practical principle or, in respect
of the human will, a categorical imperative, it must be one which, being
drawn from the conception of that which is necessarily an end for everyone
because it is an end in itself, constitutes an objective principle of will,
and can therefore serve as a universal practical law. The foundation of
this principle is: rational nature exists as an end in itself. Man necessarily
conceives his own existence as being so; so far then this is a subjective
principle of human actions. But every other rational being regards its
existence similarly, just on the same rational principle that holds for
me: so that it is at the same time an objective principle, from which as
a supreme practical law all laws of the will must be capable of being deduced.
Accordingly the practical imperative will be as follows: So act as to treat
humanity, whether in thine own person or in that of any other, in every
case as an end withal, never as means only. We will now
<br>inquire whether this can be practically carried out.
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp; To abide by the previous examples:
<p>&nbsp; Firstly, under the head of necessary duty to oneself: He who
contemplates suicide should ask himself whether his action can be consistent
with the idea of humanity as an end in itself. If he destroys himself in
order to escape from painful circumstances, he uses a person merely as
a mean to maintain a tolerable condition up to the end of life. But a man
is not a thing, that is to say, something which can be used merely as means,
but must in all his actions be always considered as an end in himself.
I cannot, therefore, dispose in any way of a man in my own person so as
to mutilate him, to damage or kill him. (It belongs to ethics proper to
define this principle more precisely, so as to avoid all misunderstanding,
e.g., as to the amputation of the limbs in order to preserve myself, as
to exposing my life to danger with a view to preserve it, etc. This question
is therefore omitted here.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, as regards necessary
duties, or those of strict obligation, towards others: He who is thinking
of making a lying
<br>promise to others will see at once that he would be using another man
merely as a mean, without the latter containing at the same time the end
in himself. For he whom I propose by such a promise to use for my own purposes
cannot possibly assent to my mode of acting towards him and, therefore,
cannot himself contain the end of this action.
<br>This violation of the principle of humanity in other men is more obvious
if we take in examples of attacks on the freedom and
<br>property of others. For then it is clear that he who transgresses the
rights of men intends to use the person of others merely as a
<br>means, without considering that as rational beings they ought always
to be esteemed also as ends, that is, as beings who must be capable of
containing in themselves the end of the very same action.
<p>&nbsp; Thirdly, as regards contingent (meritorious) duties to oneself:
It is not enough that the action does not violate humanity in our own person
as an end in itself, it must also harmonize with it. Now there are in humanity
capacities of greater perfection, which belong to the end that nature has
in view in regard to humanity in ourselves as the subject: to neglect these
might perhaps be consistent with the maintenance of humanity as an end
in itself, but not with the advancement of this end.
<p>&nbsp; Fourthly, as regards meritorious duties towards others: The natural
end which all men have is their own happiness. Now humanity might indeed
subsist, although no one should contribute anything to the happiness of
others, provided he did not intentionally withdraw anything from it; but
after all this would only harmonize negatively not positively with humanity
as an end in itself, if every one does not also endeavour, as far as in
him lies, to forward the ends of others. For the ends of any subject which
is an end in himself ought as far as possible to be my ends also, if that
conception is to have its full effect with me.
<p>&nbsp; This principle, that humanity and generally every rational nature
is an end in itself (which is the supreme limiting condition of every man's
freedom of action), is not borrowed from experience, firstly, because it
is universal, applying as it does to all rational beings whatever, and
experience is not capable of determining anything about them; secondly,
because it does not present humanity as an end to men (subjectively), that
is as an object which men do of themselves actually adopt as an end; but
as an objective end, which must as a law constitute the supreme limiting
condition of all our subjective ends, let them be what we will; it must
therefore spring from pure reason. In fact the objective principle of all
practical legislation lies (according to the first principle) in the rule
and its form of universality which makes it capable of being a law (say,
e. g., a law of nature); but the subjective principle is in the end; now
by the second principle the subject of all ends is each rational being,
inasmuch as it is an end in itself. Hence follows the third practical principle
of the will, which is the ultimate condition of its harmony with universal
practical reason, viz.: the idea of the will of every rational being as
a universally legislative will.
<p>&nbsp; On this principle all maxims are rejected which are inconsistent
with the will being itself universal legislator. Thus the will is
<br>not subject simply to the law, but so subject that it must be regarded
as itself giving the law and, on this ground only, subject to the law (of
which it can regard itself as the author).
