						<h3>The Sounds of Religion in a Time of War</h3>
						<p>I write the day after military action was launched. 
						What happens in the days and weeks ahead nobody knows, 
						and any speculation would be dated by the time you read 
						this. So there is no point in that. What can be known 
						now, and is very much worth trying to understand, is how 
						the several religious communities have attempted to 
						influence the decisions leading up to war. The following 
						is an annotated summary of positions, arguments, 
						admonitions, and agitations that reflect the ways in 
						which religious leadership tried—for better and worse—to 
						bring moral judgment to bear in a time of war.</p>
						<p>“How does it feel to be all alone, or almost all 
						alone?” The reporter’s question suggested that I was the 
						only person in a Roman collar defending American policy 
						in the media. He was not quite right about that, but it 
						is true that there weren’t many of us. And I did not 
						think of myself as defending American policy so much as 
						trying to contribute a measure of moral clarity in a 
						time of great confusion. Of course, I readily admit that 
						those who disagree thought they were the ones providing 
						moral clarity. Perhaps the best way to begin is to offer 
						a précis of the arguments I’ve been making, with special 
						reference to Catholic positions, and then come back to 
						some alternative accounts of moral duty in a time of 
						war. We will want to attend also to the sounds of 
						oldline and evangelical Protestants, as well as Jews, in 
						the public square.</p>
						<p>Up until the first rocket hit Baghdad, the Pope was 
						urging us to pray that Iraq would be disarmed without 
						resort to military force. For months he tirelessly 
						repeated that war is always a defeat for humanity, a 
						failure to maintain the peace of right order. St. 
						Augustine called the peace of right order <i>
						tranquillitas ordinis</i>. In addition, the Pope 
						urgently reminded us that in history nothing is 
						inevitable, and that with God all things are possible. 
						In every statement I have made, I have underscored my 
						unqualified agreement with that message of the Holy 
						Father.</p>
						<p>That message is entirely consistent with the teaching 
						of St. Thomas Aquinas and others in the just war 
						tradition that, in the absence of <i>tranquillitas 
						ordinis</i>, war may sometimes be a moral duty in order 
						to overturn injustice and protect the innocent. The 
						cause must be just, and the just cause in this case is 
						the disarmament of Iraq. That just cause was explicitly 
						and consistently affirmed by the Pope, also in his 
						messages to both Saddam Hussein and President Bush. And 
						it was affirmed by multiple resolutions of the UN 
						Security Council.</p>
						<p>The question was whether that just cause could be 
						vindicated without resort to military force. 
						France—despite having voted for the unanimously approved 
						Resolution 1441 that presumably gave Saddam one last 
						chance to disarm—was in the lead of those contending 
						that it would be wiser to wait and see what Iraq might 
						do over a period of months or even years, during which 
						time it could be safely contained without war. How best 
						to vindicate the just cause, I insisted, is a matter of 
						practical wisdom, of what is called prudential judgment. 
						In just war doctrine, the Church’s competence and 
						responsibility is to set forth the pertinent moral 
						principles. As No. 2309 of the <i>Catechism of the 
						Catholic Church</i> makes clear, the application of 
						those principles to specific cases is the responsibility 
						of political leaders. It is true that religious leaders 
						can claim that the principles are being ignored or 
						misapplied, but in the latter case they do so at the 
						considerable risk of exceeding their competence and 
						undermining their credibility. The questions raised to 
						religious spokesmen are inescapable: On the basis of 
						what expert knowledge do you advocate policy x against 
						policy y? By what authority or by whose authority do you 
						speak?</p>
						<h4>Criminal Negligence</h4>
						<p>It was pointed out that for twelve years Saddam 
						Hussein had successfully defied the Security Council, 
						beginning with his refusal to disarm as required by the 
						terms that ended the first Gulf War. He had been 
						responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands (some 
						authorities say over a million) people in aggressive 
						war, and had used weapons of mass destruction to 
						slaughter thousands of his own people. He possessed and 
						was bent upon further developing more horrible weapons; 
						he had publicly stated his support for the attack of 
						September 11, and was in contact and declared sympathy 
						with terrorists devoted to multiplying such attacks. 
						None of these facts were in dispute.</p>
						<p>In the judgment of the U.S. and many other 
						governments, Saddam posed a grave and imminent threat to 
						America, to world peace, and to the lives of innumerable 
						innocents. If that judgment is correct, I argued, the 
						use of military force to remove that threat is, in the 
						absence of plausible alternatives, both justified and 
						necessary. Then I always added this: heads of government 
						who are convinced of the correctness of that judgment 
						would be criminally negligent and in violation of their 
						solemn oath to protect their people if they did not act 
						to remove such a threat. </p>
						<p>I emphasized that, as a theologian and moralist, I 
						had no special competence to assess the threat posed by 
						Iraq. On the basis of available evidence and my 
						considered confidence in those responsible for making 
						the relevant decisions, I was inclined to believe and I 
						earnestly prayed that they would do the right thing. I 
						was impressed by the degree to which opposing 
						contentions turned on this question of confidence, or, 
						rather, widespread lack of confidence in—indeed contempt 
						for—George W. Bush. In the slogans of street 
						demonstrators, but also in statements by churchmen, the 
						opposition positions advanced frequently came down to 
						little more than defamation of presidential character. 
						It was not an edifying spectacle.</p>
						<p>Discussions and debates sometimes turned on the 
						meaning of preventive or preemptive war. Those terms 
						were also used by the Administration, and I argued that 
						they should not be. Some even spoke approvingly of “wars 
						of choice.” War, if it is just, is not an option chosen 
						but a duty imposed. Just war is in response to 
						aggression. Iraq’s aggression was first against Kuwait, 
						then in defiance of the terms of surrender, then in 
						support of, if not direct participation in, acts of 
						terrorism. Joined to that was the brutal aggression 
						against its own citizens, and the possession of weapons 
						of mass destruction which it could use or permit others 
						to use for further aggression. Q: But how could we know 
						what Saddam would do? A: We couldn’t know for sure. Q: 
						Wouldn’t it be better to wait and see? A: To wait until 
						he did what it was reasonable to believe he had the 
						means and intention of doing would be to wait too long. 
						Leaders guilty of such negligence would rightly be held 
						morally accountable.</p>
						<p>And so the arguments went back and forth. As it 
						happens, there is in the Catholic tradition a 
						considerable literature on prudential moral action in 
						the face of aggressive threats and great injustice. 
						Augustine, Aquinas, Francisco de Vitoria, and Francisco 
						Suarez, for example, all addressed these questions. The 
						almost total absence of reference to such recognized 
						authorities in statements by Catholics, including 
						bishops and curial officials in Rome, was impressive. Of 
						course there are novel elements in any historical 
						circumstance, but it is particularly unseemly for 
						Catholics to talk like neophiliacs, so enamored of the 
						new that they forget the centuries of reflection that is 
						the Catholic moral tradition.</p>
						<p>(sections omitted)</p>
						<h4>Elevating the Public Discourse</h4>
						<p>In the debate leading up to military action, there 
						was much understandable talk about the terrible 
						consequences of war. The question of consequences bears 
						strongly, of course, on the just war criterion of 
						proportionality. One was struck by the ways in which the 
						Bush Administration addressed the Iraq crisis with 
						explicit reference to just war doctrine, including 
						proportionality. Protests in Europe—more precisely, in 
						what is now called Old Europe—frequently alluded to 
						American inexperience and “cowboy” impetuosity. Such 
						statements would be insulting were they not so demeaning 
						of those who make them, including prelates associated 
						with the Holy See. As it is, we must exercise a measure 
						of patience with societies that have run out of steam 
						and resent the vibrancy of America. A cardinal tells me 
						that I must understand that his brethren in the Curia 
						reflect the dominant views of their own countries, which 
						are usually of the Old Europe. No doubt, but the Church 
						is supposed to be universal, as in “catholic.”</p>
						<p>On the putative dangers posed by American immaturity 
						and inexperience, one might consult the history of, say, 
						the last hundred years. I pointed out that the record of 
						the U.S. in combating tyranny, defending freedom, 
						providing humanitarian aid, motoring economic 
						development, and securing a modicum of world order 
						compares very favorably with the record of, for 
						instance, Germany, France, Russia, or Italy. Yes, it was 
						said in response, but you can’t expect Europeans to be 
						grateful forever for what the U.S. did in two World Wars 
						and the Cold War. In effect: What have you done for us 
						lately? After all, the end of the Cold War was more than 
						a decade ago. This seemed odd coming from bishops. It 
						used to be said that Rome thinks in terms of centuries.</p>
						<p>Ranking ecclesiastics took up the time of U.S. 
						decision makers, badgering them about whether they had 
						thought of this possible consequence or that. What about 
						Muslim reaction? What about civilian casualties? The 
						simple answer is that such consequences are unknowable 
						and therefore unknown, except to God. I know that 
						possible consequences have been considered, day and 
						night for many months, by competent parties. I know 
						there is a determination to minimize damage to 
						innocents, and a reasoned expectation that successful 
						action will weaken Islamist enemies of civilization and 
						strengthen the Muslim forces of decency and freedom. The 
						U.S. plans for changing the politics and culture of the 
						Middle East, including Palestinian-Israeli relations, 
						are indeed ambitious. Nobody can know for sure what will 
						happen, but religious leaders should bring more to the 
						discussion than their fears. Nervous hand-wringing is 
						not a moral argument.</p>
						<p>I had said that we should, with the Holy Father, be 
						on our knees in prayer that Iraq will disarm without 
						military action. If war comes, I said, we must pray that 
						a just cause prevails—swiftly, surely, with minimal 
						damage to innocents and with a clear determination to 
						help the Iraqi people then freed from a brutal tyranny. 
						Nobody asked or expected that the Catholic Church bless 
						military action as though it were a Christian crusade. 
						After the war, the Church, and the Holy Father in 
						particular, will be indispensable as an interlocutor in 
						moving Islam away from the most ominously destructive 
						possibilities of a “clash of civilizations.” In sum, the 
						position that some of us tried to advance during these 
						weeks and months was this: Military action in order to 
						disarm Iraq can be morally justified in terms of just 
						war doctrine. Whether, in the retrospect of history, it 
						will be viewed as a prudent course of action, nobody can 
						know. If such action is undertaken, however, we have no 
						moral alternative but to pray that a just cause will 
						prevail justly.</p>
						<p>And now war has come. By the time you read this, a 
						great deal more will likely be known about consequences. 
						At present, I’m afraid it must be said that the public 
						witness of the Catholic Church, severely battered by the 
						sex abuse scandals of the past year, has been further 
						confused and weakened. Compared to, for instance, the 
						leadership of oldline Protestantism, the Catholic 
						bishops in the U.S. have been generally careful in their 
						public statements, mainly confining themselves to 
						raising questions. When military action commenced, 
						Bishop Wilton Gregory of the U.S. episcopal conference 
						issued a carefully crafted statement, noting that 
						faithful Catholics and people of good will can disagree 
						about the wisdom of the policy, and that the Church 
						spiritually supports both those who conscientiously 
						support and those who conscientiously oppose the war. 
						The same carefulness did not characterize the statements 
						by officials of the Holy See, some of whom have come 
						unconscionably close to suggesting that Catholic 
						Americans must choose between loyalty to their country 
						and fidelity to the Church. If, as one curial archbishop 
						has declared, the coalition led by the U.S. is engaged 
						in a “crime against peace,” it would seem to follow that 
						our soldiers are engaged in a criminal activity. </p>
						<p>As you might imagine, I have received many messages 
						taking issue with what I have said. A surprising number 
						attribute to the Pope things he has not said. Don’t I 
						know that the Pope has declared the war to be “illegal,” 
						“immoral,” “in violation of the Church’s teaching,” and 
						“a crime against humanity”? No, I don’t, and I don’t 
						know that because he has never said what many are 
						claiming he said. The “crime against humanity” line was 
						cited even by the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, which, to 
						its credit, promptly retracted when the error was 
						pointed out. There are times when Catholics, and all 
						Christians, must choose between complicity in great 
						injustice and fidelity to moral truth. That choice has 
						over the centuries produced martyrs beyond numbering. 
						For a curial official even to imply that coalition 
						soldiers and others are facing such a choice is a 
						reckless abuse of ecclesiastical office. Unless, of 
						course, he really thinks that his view of the war is 
						binding upon consciences. Were that the position of the 
						Church, one would expect the Pope to say so, and the 
						Pope has not said anything even remotely like that. It 
						is to be feared that some churchmen are more enamored of 
						being players in world politics than devoted to being 
						shepherds of souls.</p>
						<p>At the same time, and somewhat contradictorily, 
						curial officials have said that they are not arguing 
						moral theology but are making prudential judgments, 
						drawing on “the Church’s vast experience in 
						international affairs.” People may be forgiven if, faced 
						with the choice between the geopolitical expertise of 
						the Curia and that of the people surrounding George W. 
						Bush and Tony Blair, they choose the latter. A crucial 
						question is this: In the past three months, has the Holy 
						See elevated the level of moral discourse or added to 
						the discussion considerations that would otherwise have 
						been neglected? It is not easy to answer that question 
						in the affirmative.</p>
						<p>His most devoted admirers acknowledge that the Pope 
						bears a measure of responsibility for this unhappy 
						circumstance. And it is a mildly amusing nuisance to 
						hear chronic dissenters from firm magisterial teaching 
						on faith and morals proclaim that, on war and peace, 
						they are loyal to the Pope, while the champions of 
						magisterial teaching are, in fact, dissenters. Well, let 
						them have their little fun while they can. With respect 
						to providing moral clarity about war and peace, it must 
						candidly be admitted that this has not been this 
						pontificate’s finest hour. But nobody should be shaken 
						too severely. Flannery O’Connor said that we sometimes 
						suffer more from the Church than for the Church. And it 
						is really not suffering so much as it is a matter of 
						disappointment, and more than a little embarrassment.</p>
