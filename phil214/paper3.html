<br><b><font color="#000099"><font size=+1>Abortion</font></font></b>
<p>In the last paper you are to present the strongest argument you can
find from one side of the issue of abortion.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should choose
your opponent's best argument for the one you will present in the beginning
of the paper.&nbsp; Make use of any material from this course that supports
the premises of the argument you present.&nbsp; The argument you present
for your opponent's view should be forceful and somewhat persuasive.&nbsp;
You will have to be dispassionate to carry out this task successfully.&nbsp;
For the purposes of this assignment, I am not interested in which view
you ultimately accept, but in how well you can present and challenge your
opponent's view while defending your own.&nbsp; Your paper will be judged, in
part, by how well you incorporate some of the strongest ideas we have discussed
and read.
<p>More specifically, in <b>Section I </b>of your paper, present a formally
valid two-premise argument for the conclusion of your opponent's argument.
Explain and justify each premise of the argument you present.&nbsp; Use
as much material from this course as is relevant to the premises of the
argument.&nbsp; I will be looking for reference to material we have been
using to discuss this issue.
<p>In <b>Section II</b> of the paper you are to critique the argument presented
in from Section I.&nbsp; Which premise of the argument is false?&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; Present an example of your own that illustrates why the premise
is false.
