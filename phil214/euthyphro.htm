<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Soc.</b> And what do you say of piety, Euthyphro: is not piety, according 
to your definition, loved by all the gods? <br>
<br>
<b>Euth.</b> Yes. <br>
<br>
<b>Soc.</b> Because it is pious or holy, or for some other reason? <br>
<br>
<b>Euth.</b> No, that is the reason. <br>
<br>
<b>Soc.</b> It is loved because it is holy, not holy because it is loved? <br>
<br>
<b>Euth.</b> Yes. <br>
<br>
<b>Soc.</b> And that which is dear to the gods is loved by them, and is in a 
state to be loved of them because it is loved of them? <br>
<br>
<b>Euth.</b> Certainly. <br>
<br>
<b>Soc.</b> Then that which is dear to the gods, Euthyphro, is not holy, nor is 
that which is holy loved of God, as you affirm; but they are two different 
things. <br>
<br>
<b>Euth.</b> How do you mean, Socrates? <br>
<br>
<b>Soc.</b> I mean to say that the holy has been acknowledge by us to be loved 
of God because it is holy, not to be holy because it is loved. <br>
<br>
<b>Euth.</b> Yes. <br>
<br>
<b>Soc.</b> But that which is dear to the gods is dear to them because it is 
loved by them, not loved by them because it is dear to them. <br>
<br>
<b>Euth.</b> True. <br>
<br>
<b>Soc.</b> But, friend Euthyphro, if that which is holy is the same with that 
which is dear to God, and is loved because it is holy, then that which is dear 
to God would have been loved as being dear to God; but if that which dear to God 
is dear to him because loved by him, then that which is holy would have been 
holy because loved by him. But now you see that the reverse is the case, and 
that they are quite different from one another. For one (theophiles) is of a 
kind to be loved cause it is loved, and the other (osion) is loved because it is 
of a kind to be loved. Thus you appear to me, Euthyphro, when I ask you what is 
the essence of holiness, to offer an attribute only, and not the essence-the 
attribute of being loved by all the gods. But you still refuse to explain to me 
the nature of holiness. And therefore, if you please, I will ask you not to hide 
your treasure, but to tell me once more what holiness or piety really is, 
whether dear to the gods or not (for that is a matter about which we will not 
quarrel) and what is impiety? <br>
<br>
<b>Euth.</b> I really do not know, Socrates, how to express what I mean. For 
somehow or other our arguments, on whatever ground we rest them, seem to turn 
round and walk away from us. </p>
