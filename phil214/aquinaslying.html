<b>Whether every lie is a sin?</b>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;OBJ 4: Further, one ought to choose the lesser evil in order
to avoid the greater: even so a physician cuts off a limb, lest the whole
body perish. Yet less harm is done by raising a false opinion in a person's
mind, than by someone slaying or being slain. Therefore a man may lawfully
lie, to save another from committing murder, or another from being killed.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;On the contrary, It is written (Ecclus. 7:14): "Be not willing
to make any manner of lie."
<p>&nbsp;I answer that, An action that is naturally evil in respect of
its genus can by no means be good and lawful, since in order for an action
to be good it must be right in every respect: because good results from
a complete cause, while evil results from any single defect, as Dionysius
asserts (Div. Nom. iv). Now a lie is evil in respect of its genus, since
it is an action bearing on undue matter. For as words are naturally signs
of intellectual acts, it is unnatural and undue for anyone to signify by
words something that is not in his mind. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic.
iv, 7) that "lying is in itself evil and to be shunned, while truthfulness
is good and worthy of praise." Therefore every lie is a sin, as also Augustine
declares (Contra Mend. i).
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 4: A lie is sinful not only because it injures one's
neighbor, but also on account of its inordinateness, as stated above in
this Article. Now it is not allowed to make use of anything inordinate
in order to ward off injury or defects from another: as neither is it lawful
to steal in order to give an alms, except perhaps in a case of necessity
when all things are common. Therefore it is not lawful to tell a lie in
order to deliver another from any danger whatever. Nevertheless it is lawful
to hide the truth prudently, by keeping it back, as Augustine says (Contra
Mend. x).
