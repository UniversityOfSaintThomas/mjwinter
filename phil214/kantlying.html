<center>FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE METAPHYSIC OF MORALS
<p>&nbsp;by Immanuel Kant</center>

<p>2. Another finds himself forced by necessity to borrow money. He knows
that he will not be able to repay it, but sees also that nothing will be
lent to him unless he promises stoutly to repay it in a definite time.
He desires to make this promise, but he has still so much conscience as
to ask himself: "Is it not unlawful and inconsistent with duty to get out
of a difficulty in this way?"
<br>Suppose however that he resolves to do so: then the maxim of his action
would be expressed thus: "When I think myself in want of money, I will
borrow money and promise to repay it, although I know that I never can
do so." Now this principle of self-love or of one's own advantage may perhaps
be consistent with my whole future welfare; but the question now is, "Is
it right?" I change then the suggestion of self-love into a universal law,
and state the question thus: "How would it be if my maxim were a universal
law?" Then I see at once that it could never hold as a universal law of
nature, but would necessarily contradict itself. For supposing it to be
a universal law that everyone when he thinks himself in a difficulty should
be able to promise whatever he pleases, with the purpose of not keeping
his promise, the promise itself would become impossible, as well as the
end that one might have in view in it, since no one would consider that
anything was promised to him, but would ridicule all such
<br>statements as vain pretences.
