<div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 100%"><b>Understanding Aristotle's Ethics: Happiness
and Health</b>
<p>I think it is helpful to try to understand Aristotle's concept of happiness
as it compares to healthiness.&nbsp; Aristotle points to a parallel between
ethics and medicine, so it might prove useful to consider some of the features
that these domains share.
<p>The goal of medicine is healthiness.&nbsp; Healthiness is not a concept
that we construct for our own convenience, but something that results when
the human body is functioning as it should.&nbsp; To become healthy we
must learn about the kinds of things that constitute healthiness for human
beings.&nbsp; We discover that some activities are always unhealthy, e.g.,
drinking poison, swimming in freezing water, etc..&nbsp; Any amount of
these activities is unhealthy.&nbsp; On the other hand, there are some
activities that we must engage in to be healthy, e.g., eating healthy food,
getting exercise, rest, etc..&nbsp; But too much of any of these things
can become bad.&nbsp; Too much exercise is hard on the body, for example.&nbsp;
So engaging in the right kinds of activities is not enough, we must aim
for the right amount.
<p>We can see how these points are parallel to ethics.&nbsp; Happiness
is an activity that follows from our function as human beings.&nbsp; We
do not decide what our function will be-- it is given to us by nature.&nbsp;
In order to be happy we need to understand what our nature is.&nbsp; Once
we have this understanding, we learn that some activities are always bad
to do, e.g., theft, adultery and murder.&nbsp; On the other hand, some
activities are necessary for our fulfillment, e.g., seeking knowledge,
making friends, etc..&nbsp;&nbsp; We must choose the right amount of each
of&nbsp; these activities.&nbsp; We will not be happy if we lock ourselves
in a room to read all the time.&nbsp; We are social animals.&nbsp; We should
seek the mean in all that we do.
<p>Just as being healthy depends on good fortune, so does happiness.&nbsp;
If one eats a balanced diet and exercises regularly but develops a disease
from drinking contaminated food, then one will not be healthy.&nbsp; The
same point applies in the moral case.&nbsp; Fulfillment comes from being
virtuous in favorable circumstances.&nbsp; It is hard to see how someone
could be happy if he/she is virtuous but subject to torture and other misfortunes.
<p>Leading a healthy lifestyle is a habit just as leading a virtuous life
is.&nbsp; Neither is necessarily pleasant at first, but both are seen as
being pleasant the more they are done.&nbsp; It is difficult to change
from an unhealthy lifestyle to a healthy one.&nbsp; It is at least as difficult
to abandon vicious habits for virtuous ones.&nbsp; We bestow higher praise
on those who do the latter because the journey is longer.
<p>Just as we can know what the right foods are and fail to eat them, we
can know what the right activities but fail to do them.&nbsp; This is weakness
of will.&nbsp; This phenomenon is as prevalent in health as it is in ethics.
