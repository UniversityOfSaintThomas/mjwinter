<p>St. Thomas Aquinas
<p>(Portions of text omitted throughout)
<p><b>Q.90, a.1: Whether law is something pertaining to reason?</b>
<p>&nbsp;I answer that, Law is a rule and measure of acts, whereby man
is induced to act or is restrained from acting: for "lex" [law] is derived
from "ligare" [to bind], because it binds one to act. Now the rule and
measure of human acts is the reason, which is the first principle of human
acts, as is evident from what has been stated above (Q1, A1, ad 3); since
it belongs to the reason to direct to the end, which is the first principle
in all matters of action, according to the Philosopher (Phys. ii). Now
that which is the principle in any genus, is the rule and measure of that
genus: for instance, unity in the genus of numbers, and the first movement
in the genus of movements. Consequently it follows that law is something
pertaining to reason.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Whether the law is always something directed to the common good?</b>
<p>&nbsp;I answer that, As stated above (A1), the law belongs to that which
is a principle of human acts, because it is their rule and measure. Now
as reason is a principle of human acts, so in reason itself there is something
which is the principle in respect of all the rest: wherefore to this principle
chiefly and mainly law must needs be referred. Now the first principle
in practical matters, which are the object of the practical reason, is
the last end: and the last end of human life is bliss or happiness, as
stated above (Q2, A7; Q3, A1). Consequently the law must needs regard principally
the relationship to happiness. Moreover, since every part is ordained to
the whole, as imperfect to perfect; and since one man is a part of the
perfect community, the law must needs regard properly the relationship
to universal happiness. Wherefore the Philosopher, in the above definition
of legal matters mentions both happiness and the body politic: for he says
(Ethic. v, 1) that we call those legal matters "just, which are adapted
to produce and preserve happiness and its parts for the body politic":
since the state is a perfect community, as he says in Polit. i, 1.
<br>&nbsp;Now in every genus, that which belongs to it chiefly is the principle
of the others, and the others belong to that genus in subordination to
that thing: thus fire, which is chief among hot things, is the cause of
heat in mixed bodies, and these are said to be hot in so far as they have
a share of fire. Consequently, since the law is chiefly ordained to the
common good, any other precept in regard to some individual work, must
needs be devoid of the nature of a law, save in so far as it regards the
common good. Therefore every law is ordained to the common good.
<p>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 1: A command denotes an application of a law to matters
regulated by the law. Now the order to the common good, at which the law
aims, is applicable to particular ends. And in this way commands are given
even concerning particular matters.
<br>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 2: Actions are indeed concerned with particular matters:
but those particular matters are referable to the common good, not as to
a common genus or species, but as to a common final cause, according as
the common good is said to be the common end.
<br>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 3: Just as nothing stands firm with regard to the speculative
reason except that which is traced back to the first indemonstrable principles,
so nothing stands firm with regard to the practical reason, unless it be
directed to the last end which is the common good: and whatever stands
to reason in this sense, has the nature of a law.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Is there an eternal law?</b>
<br>&nbsp;I answer that, As stated above (Q90, A1, ad 2; AA3,4), a law
is nothing else but a dictate of practical reason emanating from the ruler
who governs a perfect community. Now it is evident, granted that the world
is ruled by Divine Providence, as was stated in the FP, Q22, AA1,2, that
the whole community of the universe is governed by Divine Reason. Wherefore
the very Idea of the government of things in God the Ruler of the universe,
has the nature of a law. And since the Divine Reason's conception of things
is not subject to time but is eternal, according to Prov. 8:23, therefore
it is that this kind of law must be called eternal.
<p><b>Whether there was any need for a Divine law?</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I answer that, Besides the natural and the
human law it was necessary for the directing of human conduct to have a
Divine law. And this for four reasons. First, because it is by law that
man is directed how to perform his proper acts in view of his last end.
And indeed if man were ordained to no other end than that which is proportionate
to his natural faculty, there would be no need for man to have any further
direction of the part of his reason, besides the natural law and human
law which is derived from it. But since man is ordained to an end of eternal
happiness which is inproportionate to man's natural faculty, as stated
above (Q5, A5), therefore it was necessary that, besides the natural and
the human law, man should be directed to his end by a law given by God.
<br>&nbsp;Secondly, because, on account of the uncertainty of human judgment,
especially on contingent and particular matters, different people form
different judgments on human acts; whence also different and contrary laws
result. In order, therefore, that man may know without any doubt what he
ought to do and what he ought to avoid, it was necessary for man to be
directed in his proper acts by a law given by God, for it is certain that
such a law cannot err.
<br>&nbsp;Thirdly, because man can make laws in those matters of which
he is competent to judge. But man is not competent to judge of interior
movements, that are hidden, but only of exterior acts which appear: and
yet for the perfection of virtue it is necessary for man to conduct himself
aright in both kinds of acts. Consequently human law could not sufficiently
curb and direct interior acts; and it was necessary for this purpose that
a Divine law should supervene.
<br>&nbsp;Fourthly, because, as Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. i, 5,6), human
law cannot punish or forbid all evil deeds: since while aiming at doing
away with all evils, it would do away with many good things, and would
hinder the advance of the common good, which is necessary for human intercourse.
In order, therefore, that no evil might remain unforbidden and unpunished,
it was necessary for the Divine law to supervene, whereby all sins are
forbidden.
<br>&nbsp;And these four causes are touched upon in Ps. 118:8, where it
is said: "The law of the Lord is unspotted," i.e. allowing no foulness
of sin; "converting souls," because it directs not only exterior, but also
interior acts; "the testimony of the Lord is faithful," because of the
certainty of what is true and right; "giving wisdom to little ones," by
directing man to an end supernatural and Divine.
<p><b>Is there a natural law?</b>
<br>&nbsp;I answer that, As stated above (Q90, A1, ad 1), law, being a
rule and measure, can be in a person in two ways: in one way, as in him
that rules and measures; in another way, as in that which is ruled and
measured, since a thing is ruled and measured, in so far as it partakes
of the rule or measure. Wherefore, since all things subject to Divine providence
are ruled and measured by the eternal law, as was stated above (A1); it
is evident that all things partake somewhat of the eternal law, in so far
as, namely, from its being imprinted on them, they derive their respective
inclinations
to their proper acts and ends. Now among all others, the rational creature
is subject to Divine providence in the most excellent way, in so far as
it partakes of a share of providence, by being provident both for itself
and for others. Wherefore it has a share of the Eternal Reason, whereby
it has a natural inclination to its proper act and end: and this participation
of the eternal law in the rational creature is called the natural law.
Hence the Psalmist after saying (Ps. 4:6): "Offer up the sacrifice of justice,"
as though someone asked what the works of justice are, adds: "Many say,
Who showeth us good things?" in answer to which question he says: "The
light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us": thus implying that
the light of natural reason, whereby we discern what is good and what is
evil, which is the function of the natural law, is nothing else than an
imprint on us of the Divine light. It is therefore evident that the natural
law is nothing else than the rational creature's participation of the eternal
law.
<p><b>Is there human law?</b>
<br>&nbsp;I answer that, As stated above (Q90, A1, ad 2), a law is a dictate
of the practical reason. Now it is to be observed that the same procedure
takes place in the practical and in the speculative reason: for each proceeds
from principles to conclusions, as stated above (De Lib. Arb. i, 6). Accordingly
we conclude that just as, in the speculative reason, from naturally known
indemonstrable principles, we draw the conclusions of the various sciences,
the knowledge of which is not imparted to us by nature, but acquired by
the efforts of reason, so too it is from the precepts of the natural law,
as from general and indemonstrable principles, that the human reason needs
to proceed to the more particular determination of certain matters. These
particular determinations, devised by human reason, are called human laws,
provided the other essential conditions of law be observed, as stated above
(Q90, AA2,3,4). Wherefore Tully says in his Rhetoric (De Invent. Rhet.
ii) that "justice has its source in nature; thence certain things came
into custom by reason of their utility; afterwards these things which emanated
from nature and were approved by custom, were sanctioned by fear and reverence
for the law."
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Q.94: Does the natural law contain one precept or many?</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the contrary, The precepts of the natural
law in man stand in relation to practical matters, as the first principles
to matters of demonstration. But there are several first indemonstrable
principles. Therefore there are also several precepts of the natural law.
<br>&nbsp;I answer that, As stated above (Q91, A3), the precepts of the
natural law are to the practical reason, what the first principles of demonstrations
are to the speculative reason; because both are self evident principles.
Now a thing is said to be self evident in two ways: first, in itself; secondly,
in relation to us. Any proposition is said to be self evident in itself,
if its predicate is contained in the notion of the subject: although, to
one who knows not the definition of the subject, it happens that such a
proposition is not self evident. For instance, this proposition, "Man is
a rational being," is, in its very nature, self evident, since who says
"man," says "a rational being": and yet to one who knows not what a man
is, this proposition is not self evident. Hence it is that, as Boethius
says (De Hebdom.), certain axioms or propositions are universally self
evident to all; and such are those propositions whose terms are known to
all, as, "Every whole is greater than its part," and, "Things equal to
one and the same are equal to one another." But some propositions are self
evident only to the wise, who understand the meaning of the terms of such
propositions: thus to one who understands that an angel is not a body,
it is self evident that an angel is not circumscriptively in a place: but
this is not evident to the unlearned, for they cannot grasp it.
<br>&nbsp;Now a certain order is to be found in those things that are apprehended
universally. For that which, before aught else, falls under apprehension,
is "being," the notion of which is included in all things whatsoever a
man apprehends. Wherefore the first indemonstrable principle is that "the
same thing cannot be affirmed and denied at the same time," which is based
on the notion of "being" and "not being": and on this principle all others
are based, as is stated in Metaph. iv, text. 9. Now as "being" is the first
thing that falls under the apprehension simply, so "good" is the first
thing that falls under the apprehension of the practical reason, which
is directed to action: since every agent acts for an end under the aspect
of good. Consequently the first principle of practical reason is one founded
on the notion of good, viz. that "good is that which all things seek after."
Hence this is the first precept of law, that "good is to be done and pursued,
and evil is to be avoided." All other precepts of the natural law are based
upon this: so that whatever the practical reason naturally apprehends as
man's good (or evil) belongs to the precepts of the natural law as something
to be done or avoided.
<br>&nbsp;Since, however, good has the nature of an end, and evil, the
nature of a contrary, hence it is that all those things to which man has
a natural inclination, are naturally apprehended by reason as being good,
and consequently as objects of pursuit, and their contraries as evil, and
objects of avoidance. Wherefore according to the order of natural inclinations,
is the order of the precepts of the natural law. Because in man there is
first of all an inclination to good in accordance with the nature which
he has in common with all substances: inasmuch as every substance seeks
the preservation of its own being, according to its nature: and by reason
of this inclination, whatever is a means of preserving human life, and
of warding off its obstacles, belongs to the natural law. Secondly, there
is in man an inclination to things that pertain to him more specially,
according to that nature which he has in common with other animals: and
in virtue of this inclination, those things are said to belong to the natural
law, "which nature has taught to all animals" [*Pandect. Just. I, tit.
i], such as sexual intercourse, education of offspring and so forth. Thirdly,
there is in man an inclination to good, according to the nature of his
reason, which nature is proper to him: thus man has a natural inclination
to know the truth about God, and to live in society: and in this respect,
whatever pertains to this inclination belongs to the natural law; for instance,
to shun ignorance, to avoid offending those among whom one has to live,
and other such things regarding the above inclination.
<p>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 1: All these precepts of the law of nature have the
character of one natural law, inasmuch as they flow from one first precept.
<br>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 2: All the inclinations of any parts whatsoever of
human nature, e.g. of the concupiscible and irascible parts, in so far
as they are ruled by reason, belong to the natural law, and are reduced
to one first precept, as stated above: so that the precepts of the natural
law are many in themselves, but are based on one common foundation.
<br>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 3: Although reason is one in itself, yet it directs
all things regarding man; so that whatever can be ruled by reason, is contained
under the law of reason.
<br>Whether the natural law can be changed?
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Whether the natural law is the same in all men?</b>
<p>&nbsp;OBJ 3: Further, as stated above (AA2,3), to the natural law belongs
everything to which a man is inclined according to his nature. Now different
men are naturally inclined to different things; some to the desire of pleasures,
others to the desire of honors, and other men to other things. Therefore
there is not one natural law for all.
<br>&nbsp;On the contrary, Isidore says (Etym. v, 4): "The natural law
is common to all nations."
<br>&nbsp;I answer that, As stated above (AA2,3), to the natural law belongs
those things to which a man is inclined naturally: and among these it is
proper to man to be inclined to act according to reason. Now the process
of reason is from the common to the proper, as stated in Phys. i. The speculative
reason, however, is differently situated in this matter, from the practical
reason. For, since the speculative reason is busied chiefly with the necessary
things, which cannot be otherwise than they are, its proper conclusions,
like the universal principles, contain the truth without fail. The practical
reason, on the other hand, is busied with contingent matters, about which
human actions are concerned: and consequently, although there is necessity
in the general principles, the more we descend to matters of detail, the
more frequently we encounter defects. Accordingly then in speculative matters
truth is the same in all men, both as to principles and as to conclusions:
although the truth is not known to all as regards the conclusions, but
only as regards the principles which are called common notions. But in
matters of action, truth or practical rectitude is not the same for all,
as to matters of detail, but only as to the general principles: and where
there is the same rectitude in matters of detail, it is not equally known
to all.
<br>&nbsp;It is therefore evident that, as regards the general principles
whether of speculative or of practical reason, truth or rectitude is the
same for all, and is equally known by all. As to the proper conclusions
of the speculative reason, the truth is the same for all, but is not equally
known to all: thus it is true for all that the three angles of a triangle
are together equal to two right angles, although it is not known to all.
But as to the proper conclusions of the practical reason, neither is the
truth or rectitude the same for all, nor, where it is the same, is it equally
known by all. Thus it is right and true for all to act according to reason:
and from this principle it follows as a proper conclusion, that goods entrusted
to another should be restored to their owner. Now this is true for the
majority of cases: but it may happen in a particular case that it would
be injurious, and therefore unreasonable, to restore goods held in trust;
for instance, if they are claimed for the purpose of fighting against one's
country. And this principle will be found to fail the more, according as
we descend further into detail, e.g. if one were to say that goods held
in trust should be restored with such and such a guarantee, or in such
and such a way; because the greater the number of conditions added, the
greater the number of ways in which the principle may fail, so that it
be not right to restore or not to restore.
<br>&nbsp;Consequently we must say that the natural law, as to general
principles, is the same for all, both as to rectitude and as to knowledge.
But as to certain matters of detail, which are conclusions, as it were,
of those general principles, it is the same for all in the majority of
cases, both as to rectitude and as to knowledge; and yet in some few cases
it may fail, both as to rectitude, by reason of certain obstacles (just
as natures subject to generation and corruption fail in some few cases
on account of some obstacle), and as to knowledge, since in some the reason
is perverted by passion, or evil habit, or an evil disposition of nature;
thus formerly, theft, although it is expressly contrary to the natural
law, was not considered wrong among the Germans, as Julius Caesar relates
(De Bello Gall. vi).
<br>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 3: As, in man, reason rules and commands the other
powers, so all the natural inclinations belonging to the other powers must
needs be directed according to reason. Wherefore it is universally right
for all men, that all their inclinations should be directed according to
reason.
<p><b>Can the natural law be changed?</b>
<p>&nbsp;I answer that, A change in the natural law may be understood in
two ways. First, by way of addition. In this sense nothing hinders the
natural law from being changed: since many things for the benefit of human
life have been added over and above the natural law, both by the Divine
law and by human laws.
<br>&nbsp;Secondly, a change in the natural law may be understood by way
of subtraction, so that what previously was according to the natural law,
ceases to be so. In this sense, the natural law is altogether unchangeable
in its first principles: but in its secondary principles, which, as we
have said (A4), are certain detailed proximate conclusions drawn from the
first principles, the natural law is not changed so that what it prescribes
be not right in most cases. But it may be changed in some particular cases
of rare occurrence, through some special causes hindering the observance
of such precepts, as stated above (A4).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Can the natural law be abolished from the human heart?</b>
<p>&nbsp;On the contrary, Augustine says (Confess. ii): "Thy law is written
in the hearts of men, which iniquity itself effaces not." But the law which
is written in men's hearts is the natural law. Therefore the natural law
cannot be blotted out.
<br>&nbsp;I answer that, As stated above (AA4,5), there belong to the natural
law, first, certain most general precepts, that are known to all; and secondly,
certain secondary and more detailed precepts, which are, as it were, conclusions
following closely from first principles. As to those general principles,
the natural law, in the abstract, can nowise be blotted out from men's
hearts. But it is blotted out in the case of a particular action, in so
far as reason is hindered from applying the general principle to a particular
point of practice, on account of concupiscence or some other passion, as
stated above (Q77, A2). But as to the other, i.e. the secondary precepts,
the natural law can be blotted out from the human heart, either by evil
persuasions, just as in speculative matters errors occur in respect of
necessary conclusions; or by vicious customs and corrupt habits, as among
some men, theft, and even unnatural vices, as the Apostle states (Rm. i),
were not esteemed sinful.
<p>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 1: Sin blots out the law of nature in particular cases,
not universally, except perchance in regard to the secondary precepts of
the natural law, in the way stated above.
<p><b>Is every human law derived from the natural law?</b>
<p>&nbsp;OBJ 3: Further, the law of nature is the same for all; since the
Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 7) that "the natural just is that which is
equally valid everywhere." If therefore human laws were derived from the
natural law, it would follow that they too are the same for all: which
is clearly false.
<br>&nbsp;I answer that, As Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. i, 5) "that which
is not just seems to be no law at all": wherefore the force of a law depends
on the extent of its justice. Now in human affairs a thing is said to be
just, from being right, according to the rule of reason. But the first
rule of reason is the law of nature, as is clear from what has been stated
above (Q91, A2, ad 2). Consequently every human law has just so much of
the nature of law, as it is derived from the law of nature. But if in any
point it deflects from the law of nature, it is no longer a law but a perversion
of law.
<br>&nbsp;But it must be noted that something may be derived from the natural
law in two ways: first, as a conclusion from premises, secondly, by way
of determination of certain generalities. The first way is like to that
by which, in sciences, demonstrated conclusions are drawn from the principles:
while the second mode is likened to that whereby, in the arts, general
forms are particularized as to details: thus the craftsman needs to determine
the general form of a house to some particular shape. Some things are therefore
derived from the general principles of the natural law, by way of conclusions;
e.g. that "one must not kill" may be derived as a conclusion from the principle
that "one should do harm to no man": while some are derived therefrom by
way of determination; e.g. the law of nature has it that the evil doer
should be punished; but that he be punished in this or that way, is a determination
of the law of nature.
<br>&nbsp;Accordingly both modes of derivation are found in the human law.
But those things which are derived in the first way, are contained in human
law not as emanating therefrom exclusively, but have some force from the
natural law also. But those things which are derived in the second way,
have no other force than that of human law.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;Reply OBJ 3: The general principles of the natural law cannot
be applied to all men in the same way on account of the great variety of
human affairs: and hence arises the diversity of positive laws among various
people.
