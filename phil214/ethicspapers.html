<b><font color="#000099"><font size=+1>General Structure for
Papers</font></font></b>
<p>I. Introduction
<br>II. Presentation of Argument
<br>III. Assessment of Argument
<br>IV. Conclusion
<blockquote><b>I. Introduction-</b> In this portion of the paper present
the question or thesis you intend to address. You might explain the context
in which the question/thesis occurs. For example, if you are treating Plato's
recollection argument, you might mention how this argument fits into Plato's
overall strategy in the Phaedo.
<p><b>II. Presentation of Argument-</b> Now present the main argument.
For the sake of clarity and organization, state the argument in one of
the forms covered on the logic handout (as has been done in class and in
homework). Use the text to support the premises of the argument. If the
argument is not explicitly stated in any of the forms we have discussed,
see if you are able to make it fit one of the patterns while doing justice
to the intended line of thought (remember the Principle of Charity here).
Explain the stages in the argument and discuss what it purports to show.
<p><b>III. Assessment of Argument-</b> At this stage you will be in a position
to discuss (a) the legitimacy of the inference (valid or invalid) and (b)
the truth or falsity of the premises. Analyze each premise of the argument
by stating the evidence or principles upon which they are based. Discuss
strengths and weaknesses in the argument. Note: This portion of the paper
is where creativity plays its role. Use your imagination to come up with
an example of your own to illustrate the reasoning you employ.
<p><b>IV. Conclusion</b>- A conclusion gives you the opportunity to wrap
things up. Summarize the reasoning and analysis you have employed. Also,
state your own view of the matter. Why are you reluctant or willing to
accept the conclusion? You might state some possible implications of the
argument you assess.</blockquote>
<b><font color="#000099"><font size=+1>Paper Assignment #1</font></font></b>
<p>In the final issue of the television show M.A.S.H., civilians and soldiers
are hiding in a bus in cover from the North Korean Enemy.&nbsp; As the
enemy troops near the place where the bus is hidden, a woman's baby begins
to cry.&nbsp; The woman tries to calm the baby so that the enemy will not
detect the bus, but the baby continues to cry.&nbsp; In desperation, the
woman suffocates the baby with her own hand.&nbsp; Hawkeye is so overwhelmed
by the incident that he later loses emotional control.&nbsp; After much
psychiatric work, Hawkeye is able to come to terms with the episode.
<p>Suppose that everyone in the bus would have been killed had the enemy
detected the bus.&nbsp; Suppose that woman who suffocates the baby has
good reason for believing this fact.&nbsp; A good utilitarian would argue
that she has done the right thing, and that Hawkeye's response to the incident
is a sign of moral weakness or ignorance.
<p>Construct a formally valid argument that a utilitarian would offer to
justify the woman's action.&nbsp; Take the conclusion of the argument to
be: Sacrificing my baby's life is morally required.&nbsp; Once you set
up a valid utilitarian argument in section 2, explain the premises of the
argument using the theoretical considerations from Mill that support it.
<p>In section 3 critically evaluate the argument using theoretical considerations
from Kant and Aquinas that count against the truth of the premises of the
argument.&nbsp; <b>Provide an example of your own that justifies one of
the criticisms in section 3.&nbsp; Due to space consideration, leave out
the introduction and conclusion.</b>

<p><b><font color="#000099"><font size=+1>Paper #2</font></font></b>
<br>Due at our last class session
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For this assignment, you will need to read three articles
on euthanasia found in our anthology.&nbsp; The first is by Rachels, the
second by Sullivan, and the third by Rachels.&nbsp; In effect, this assignment
asks you to think how Sullivan would respond if he were to write a fourth
article.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; In “More Impertinent Distinctions and a Defense of Active
Euthanasia” James Rachels presents an argument of the following sort:
<br>1) Any distinction among actions relying on the significance of intent
is irrelevant.
<br>2) Any difference between passive euthanasia and withholding extraordinary
means relies on the significance of intent.
<br>3) Therefore, any difference between passive euthanasia and withholding
extraordinary means is irrelevant.
<p>I would like you to write a 3 page analysis of this argument.&nbsp;
First justify each premise of the argument from Rachels’ perspective.&nbsp;
Then explain why Thomas Sullivan would reject Rachels’ argument.&nbsp;
You will need to present reasons that make it clear why Sullivan would
reject premise (1), and how Sullivan would respond to Rachels’ justification
of (1).&nbsp; You will have to provide one or two examples of your own
to show why Sullivan would say (1) is false.
<p><b>Warning:</b>&nbsp; Sullivan would not respond by conceding Rachels’
point about the relevance of intent only for assessing someone’s character.&nbsp;
Sullivan believes that intention is relevant for distinguishing between
actions.
