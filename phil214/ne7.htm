<P>&nbsp;3&nbsp; Of some such kind are the difficulties that arise; some
of these points must be refuted and the others left in possession of the
field; for the solution of the difficulty is the discovery of the truth.
We must consider first, then, whether incontinent people act knowingly
or not, and in what sense knowingly; then with what sorts of object the
incontinent and the continent man may be said to be concerned (i.e. whether
with any and every pleasure and pain or with certain determinate kinds),
and whether the continent man and the man of endurance are the same or
different; and similarly with regard to the other matters germane to this
inquiry. The starting-point of our investigation is the question whether
the continent man and the incontinent are differentiated by their objects
or by their attitude, i.e. whether the continent man is incontinent simply
by being concerned with such and such objects, or, instead, by his attitude,
or, instead of that, by both these things; the second question is whether
incontinence and continence are concerned with any and every object or
not. The man who is incontinent in the unqualified sense is neither concerned
with any and every object, but with precisely those with which the self-indulgent
man is concerned, nor is he characterized by being simply related to these
(for then his state would be the same as self-indulgence), but by being
related to them in a certain way. For the one is led on in accordance with
his own choice, thinking that he ought always to pursue the present pleasure;
while the other does not think so, but yet pursues it.

<P>&nbsp;As for the suggestion that it is true opinion and not knowledge
against which we act incontinently, that makes no difference to the argument;
for some people when in a state of opinion do not hesitate, but think they
know exactly. If, then, it is owing to their weak conviction those who
have opinion are more likely to act against their belief than those who
know, there will be no difference between knowledge and opinion; for some
men are no less convinced of what they think than others of what they know;
as is shown by the case of Heraclitus. But since we use the word 'know'
in two senses (for both the man who has knowledge but is not using it and
he who is using it are said to know), it will make a difference whether,
when a man does what he should not, he has the knowledge but is not exercising
it, or is exercising it; for the latter seems strange, but not the former.

<P>&nbsp;Further, since there are two kinds of propositions, there is nothing
to prevent a man's having both and acting against his knowledge, provided
that he is using only the universal and not the particular; for it is particular
acts that have to be done. And there are also two kinds of universal; one
is predicable of the agent, the other of the object; e.g. 'dry food is
good for every man', and 'I am a man', or 'such and such food is dry';
but whether this food is such and such, of this the incontinent man either
has not or is not exercising the knowledge. There will, then, be, firstly,
an enormous difference between these manners of knowing, so that to know
in one way would not seem anything strange, while to know in the other
way would be extraordinary.

<P>&nbsp;And further the possession of knowledge in another sense than
those just named is something that happens to men; for within the case
of having knowledge but not using it we see a difference of state, admitting
of the possibility of having knowledge in a sense and yet not having it,
as in the instance of a man asleep, mad, or drunk. But now this is just
the condition of men under the influence of passions; for outbursts of
anger and sexual appetites and some other such passions, it is evident,
actually alter our bodily condition, and in some men even produce fits
of madness. It is plain, then, that incontinent people must be said to
be in a similar condition to these. The fact that men use the language
that flows from knowledge proves nothing; for even men under the influence
of these passions utter scientific proofs and verses of Empedocles, and
those who have just begun to learn can string together words, but do not
yet know; for it has to become part of themselves, and that takes time;
so that we must suppose that the use of language by men in an incontinent
state means no more than its utterance by actors on the stage.

<P>&nbsp;Again, we may also view the cause as follows with reference to
the facts of nature. The one opinion is universal, the other is concerned
with the particular facts, and here we come to something within the sphere
of perception; when a single opinion results from the two, the soul must
in one type of case affirm the conclusion, while in the case of opinions
concerned with production it must immediately act (e.g. if everything sweet
ought to be tasted, and this is sweet, in the sense of being one of the
particular sweet things, the man who can act and is not restrained must
at the same time actually act accordingly). When, then, the universal opinion
is present in us restraining us from tasting, and there is also the opinion
that everything sweet is pleasant, and that this is sweet (now this is
the opinion that is active), and when appetite happens to be present in
us, the one opinion bids us avoid the object, but appetite leads us towards
it (for it can move each of our bodily parts); so that it turns out that
a man behaves incontinently under the influence (in a sense) of reason
and opinion, and of opinion not contrary in itself, but only incidentally--for
the appetite is contrary not the opinion--to right reason. It also follows
that this is the reason why the lower animals are not incontinent, viz.
because they have no universal beliefs but only imagination and memory
of particulars.

<P>&nbsp;The explanation of how the ignorance is dissolved and the incontinent
man regains his knowledge, is the same as in the case of the man drunk
or asleep and is not peculiar to this condition; we must go to the students
of natural science for it. Now, the last proposition both being an opinion
about a perceptible object, and being what determines our actions, this
a man either has not when he is in the state of passion, or has it in the
sense in which having knowledge did not mean knowing but only talking,
as a drunken man may utter the verses of Empedocles. And because the last
term is not universal nor equally an object of knowledge with the universal
term, the position that Socrates sought to establish actually seems to
result; for it is not what is thought to be knowledge proper that the passion
overcomes^61 (nor is it this that is dragged about as a result of the passion),
but perceptual knowledge.

<P>&nbsp;This must suffice as our answer to the question of whether men
can act incontinently when they know or not, and in what sense they know.

<P>&nbsp;4&nbsp; We must next discuss whether there is any one who is incontinent
without qualification, or all men who are incontinent are so in a particular
sense, and if so, with what sort of objects. That both continent persons
and persons of endurance, and incontinent and soft persons, are concerned
with pleasures and pains, is evident.

<P>&nbsp;Now of the things that produce pleasure some are necessary, while
others are worthy of choice in themselves but admit of excess, the bodily
causes of pleasure being necessary (by such I mean both those concerned
with food and those concerned with sexual intercourse, i.e. the bodily
matters with which we defined self-indulgence and temperance as being concerned),
while the others are not necessary but worthy of choice in themselves (e.g.
victory, honour, wealth, and good and pleasant things of this sort). This
being so, those who go to excess with reference to the latter, contrary
to the right reason which is in themselves, are not called incontinent
simply, but incontinent with the qualification 'in respect of money, gain,
honour, or anger',--not simply incontinent, on the ground that they are
different from incontinent people and are called incontinent by reason
of a resemblance. (Compare the case of Man, who won a contest at the Olympic
games; in his case the general formula of man differed little from the
one peculiar to him, but yet it was different.) This is shown by the fact
that incontinence either without qualification or in some particular respect
is blamed not only as a fault but as a kind of vice, while none of the
others is so blamed.

<P>&nbsp;But of the people who are incontinent with respect to bodily enjoyments,
with which we say the temperate and the self-indulgent man are concerned,
he who pursues the excesses of things pleasant--and shuns those of things
painful, of hunger and thirst and heat and cold and all the objects of
touch and taste--not by choice but contrary to his choice and his judgement,
is called incontinent, not with the qualification 'in respect of this or
that', e.g. of anger, but without qualification. This is confirmed by the
fact that men are called soft with regard to these pleasures, but not with
regard to any of the others. And for this reason we group together the
incontinent and the self-indulgent, the continent and the temperate man--but
not any of these other types--because they are concerned somehow with the
same pleasures and pains; but although these are concerned with the same
objects, they are not similarly related to them, but some of them choose
them while the others do not choose them.

<P>&nbsp;This is why we should describe as self-indulgent rather the man
who without appetite or with but a slight appetite pursues the excesses
and avoids moderate pains, than the man who does so because of his strong
appetites; for what would the former do, if he had in addition a vigorous
appetite, and a violent pain at the lack of the necessary objects?

<P>&nbsp;Now of appetites and pleasures some belong to the class of things
generically noble and good--for some pleasant things are by nature worthy
of choice--while others are contrary to these, and others are intermediate,
to adopt our previous distinction, e.g. wealth, gain, victory, honour.
And with reference to all objects whether of this or of the intermediate
kind men are not blamed for being affected by them, for desiring and loving
them, but for doing so in a certain way, i.e. for going to excess. (This
is why all those who contrary to reason either are mastered by or pursue
one of the objects which are naturally noble and good, e.g. those who busy
themselves more than they ought about honour or about children and parents--for
these too are goods, and those who busy themselves about them are praised;
but yet there is an excess even in them--if like Niobe one were to fight
even against the gods, or were to be as much devoted to one's father as
Satyrus nicknamed 'the filial', who was thought to be very silly on this
point.) There is no wickedness, then, with regard to these objects, for
the reason named, viz. because each of them is by nature a thing worthy
of choice for its own sake; yet excesses in respect of them are bad and
to be avoided. Similarly there is no incontinence with regard to them;
for incontinence is not only to be avoided but is also a thing worthy of
blame; but owing to a similarity in the passion people apply the name incontinence,
adding in each case what it is in respect of, as we may describe as a bad
doctor or a bad actor one whom we should not call bad, simply. As, then,
is the case we do not apply the term without qualification because each
of these conditions is not badness but only analogous to it, so it is clear
that in the other case also that alone must be taken to be incontinence
and continence which is concerned with the same objects as temperance and
self-indulgence, but we apply the term to anger by virtue of a resemblance;
and this is why we say with a qualification 'incontinent in respect of
anger' as we say 'incontinent in respect of honour, or of gain'.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>[text omitted]

<P>&nbsp;8&nbsp; The self-indulgent man, as was said, has no regrets; for
he stands by his choice; but any incontinent man is subject to regrets.
This is why the position is not as it was expressed in the formulation
of the problem, but the self-indulgent man is incurable and the incontinent
man curable; for wickedness is like a disease such as dropsy or consumption,
while incontinence is like epilepsy; the former is a permanent, the latter
an intermittent badness. And generally incontinence and vice are different
in kind; vice is unconscious of itself, incontinence is not (of incontinent
men themselves, those who become beside themselves are better than those
who possess reason but do not abide by it, since the latter are defeated
by a weaker passion, and do not act without previous deliberation like
the others); for the incontinent man is like the people who get drunk quickly
and on little wine, i.e. on less than most people.

<P>&nbsp;Evidently, then, incontinence is not vice (though perhaps it is
so in a qualified sense); for incontinence is contrary to choice while
vice is in accordance with choice; not but what they are similar in respect
of the actions they lead to; as in the saying of Demodocus about the Milesians,
'the Milesians are not without sense, but they do the things that senseless
people do', so too incontinent people are not unjust but they will do unjust
acts.

<P>&nbsp;Now, since the incontinent man is apt to pursue, not on conviction,
bodily pleasures that are excessive and contrary to right reason, while
the self-indulgent man is convinced because he is the sort of man to pursue
them, it is on the contrary the former that is easily persuaded to change
his mind, while the latter is not. For excellence and vice respectively
preserve and destroy the first principle, and in actions that for the sake
of which is the first principle, as the hypotheses are in mathematics;
neither in that case is it reason that teaches the first principles, nor
is it so here--excellence either natural or produced by habituation is
what teaches right opinion about the first principle. Such a man as this,
then, is temperate; his contrary is the self-indulgent.

<P>&nbsp;But there is a sort of man who is carried away as a result of
passion and contrary to right reason--a man whom passion masters so that
he does not act according to right reason, but does not master to the extent
of making him ready to believe that he ought to pursue such pleasures without
reserve; this is the incontinent man, who is better than the self-indulgent
man, and not bad without qualification; for the best thing in him, the
first principle, is preserved. And contrary to him is another kind of man,
he who abides by his convictions and is not carried away, at least as a
result of passion. It is evident from these considerations that the latter
is a good state and the former a bad one.

<P>&nbsp;9&nbsp; Is the man continent who abides by any and every reasoning
and any and every choice, or the man who abides by the right choice, and
is he incontinent who abandons any and every choice and any and every reasoning,
or he who abandons the reasoning that is not false and the choice that
is right? this is how we put it before our statement of the problem. Or
is it incidentally any and every choice but per se the true reasoning and
the right choice by which the one abides and the other does not? If any
one chooses or pursues this for the sake of that, per se he pursues and
chooses the latter, but incidentally the former. But when we speak without
qualification we mean what is per se. Therefore in a sense the one abides
by, and the other abandons, any and every opinion; but without qualification,
the true opinion.

<P>&nbsp;There are some who are apt to abide by their opinion, who are
called strong-headed, viz. those who are hard to persuade and are not easily
persuaded to change; these have in them something like the continent man,
as the prodigal is in a way like the liberal man and the rash man like
the confident man; but they are different in many respects. For it is to
passion and appetite that the one will not yield, since on occasion the
continent man will be easy to persuade; but it is to reason that the others
refuse to yield, for they do form appetites and many of them are led by
their pleasures. Now the people who are strong-headed are the opinionated,
the ignorant, and the boorish--the opinionated being influenced by pleasure
and pain; for they delight in the victory they gain if they are not persuaded
to change, and are pained if their decisions become null and void as decrees
sometimes do; so that they are more like the incontinent than the continent
man.

<P>&nbsp;But there are some who fail to abide by their resolutions, not
as a result of incontinence, e.g. Neoptolemus in Sophocles' Philoctetes;
yet it was for the sake of pleasure that he did not stand fast--but a noble
pleasure; for telling the truth was noble to him, but he had been persuaded
by Odysseus to tell the lie. For not every one who does anything for the
sake of pleasure is either self-indulgent or bad or incontinent, but he
who does it for a disgraceful pleasure.

<P>&nbsp;Since there is also a sort of man who takes less delight than
he should in bodily things, and does not abide by reason, he who is intermediate
between him and the incontinent man is the continent man; for the incontinent
man fails to abide by reason because he delights too much in them, and
this man because he delights in them too little; while the continent man
abides by it and does not change on either account. Now if continence is
good, both the contrary states must be bad, as they actually appear to
be; but because the other extreme is seen in few people and seldom, as
temperance is thought to be contrary only to self-indulgence, so is continence
to incontinence.

<P>&nbsp;Since many names are applied analogically, it is by analogy that
we have come to speak of the continence of the temperate man; for both
the continent man and the temperate man are such as to do nothing contrary
to reason for the sake of the bodily pleasures, but the former has and
the latter has not bad appetites, and the latter is such as not to feel
pleasure contrary to reason, while the former is such as to feel pleasure
but not to be led by it. And the incontinent and the self-indulgent man
are also like one another; they are different, but both pursue bodily pleasures--the
latter, however, also thinking that he ought to do so, while the former
does not think this.

<P>&nbsp;10&nbsp; Nor can the same man have practical wisdom and be incontinent;
for it has been shown that a man is at the same time practically wise,
and good in respect of character. Further, a man has practical wisdom not
by knowing only but by acting; but the incontinent man is unable to act--there
is, however, nothing to prevent a clever man from being incontinent; this
is why it is sometimes actually thought that some people have practical
wisdom but are incontinent, viz. because cleverness and practical wisdom
differ in the way we have described in our first discussions, and are near
together in respect of their reasoning, but differ in respect of their
choice--nor yet is the incontinent man like the man who knows and is contemplating
a truth, but like the man who is asleep or drunk. And he acts voluntarily
(for he acts in a sense with knowledge both of what he does and of that
for the sake of which he does it), but is not wicked since his choice is
good; so that he is half-wicked. And he is not unjust; for he does not
act of malice aforethought; of the two types of incontinent man the one
does not abide by the conclusions of his deliberation, while the excitable
man does not deliberate at all. And thus the incontinent man is like a
city which passes all the right decrees and has good laws, but makes no
use of them, as in Anaxandrides' jesting remark,

<P>&nbsp;'The city willed it, that cares nought for laws';

<P>but the wicked man is like a city that uses its laws, but has wicked
laws to use.

<P>&nbsp;Now incontinence and continence are concerned with that which
is in excess of the state characteristic of most men; for the continent
man abides by his resolutions more and the incontinent man less than most
men can.

<P>&nbsp;Of the forms of incontinence, that of excitable people is more
curable than that of those who deliberate but do not abide by their decisions,
and those who are incontinent through habituation are more curable than
those in whom incontinence is innate; for it is easier to change a habit
than to change one's nature; even habit is hard to change just because
it is like nature, as Evenus says:

<P>&nbsp;I say that habit's but long practice, friend,
<BR>&nbsp;And this becomes men's nature in the end.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;We have now stated what continence, incontinence, endurance, and
softness are, and how these states are related to each other.
