<p>Imagine a conversation between A and B.&nbsp; A is subjectivist.&nbsp;
B has more ordinary beliefs about morality.&nbsp; This short dialogue below
indicates that a person with ordinary beliefs about morality can refute
the subjectivist in short order by asking the right question.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="CG Times"><b>A</b>: <b><i>"There are no objective moral
standards."</i></b></font>
<p><font face="CG Times">-Since this proposition has no prescriptive element,
it is not a moral claim. So it is not inconsistent as it stands.</font>
<br><font face="CG Times">-One can reasonably say that a standard is objective
when it can be applied to more than one individual and when it holds true
independently of an individual's beliefs and desires.</font>
<p><font face="CG Times"><b>B</b>: <b><i>"Since I naively believe that
are at least some objective moral standards, but your position implies
that I am mistaken, could you please tell me how I should conduct myself?"</i></b></font>
<p><font face="CG Times">-B is justified in asking this question since
there are presumptive grounds for thinking that there at least some objective
moral standards, e.g., one should not torture infants for pleasant amusement.
The burden of proof rests on the shoulders of someone who would deny that
there are objective moral standards since experience speaks in favor of
at least some. Also, the claim "No A is B" is quite strong.</font>
<br><font face="CG Times">-Since A offers universal claims about the nature
of morality, B is justified in asking A how morality applies to him/her.</font>
<p><font face="CG Times"><b>A</b>: <b><i>"Do whatever you feel like doing."or</i></b></font>
<br><b><i><font face="CG Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pursue any desire you
might have." or</font></i></b>
<br><b><i><font face="CG Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Decide for yourself."</font></i></b>
<p><font face="CG Times">-An advocate of subjectivism is likely to make
one of these claims or some other variation of some such claim.</font>
<br><font face="CG Times">-All of the above are moral claims because each
contains a prescriptive element. Moreover, each proposition provides an
objective moral standard because one can praise or blame another by appealing
to any of these propositions. Each of the propositions contains subjective
content, but they are all objective claims nevertheless. So moral relativism
is incoherent if it is relevant since any response like this from A is
incompatible with A's first statement.</font>
<br><font face="CG Times">-If A refuses to make an assertion at this stage,
then his position is uninteresting. If A cannot make a meaningful claim
beyond his first assertion, then he really cannot pretend to understand
what morality is about-- in this case A's position is not intellectually
compelling.</font>
<br><font face="CG Times">-So subjectivism is either incoherent or not
intellectually compelling.</font>
