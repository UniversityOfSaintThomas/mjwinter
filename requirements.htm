<p><b><font color="#000099"><font size=+2>Course Description</font></font></b>
<p>Philosophy 115 is designed to help students acquire the skill needed
to examine and evaluate arguments and texts concerned with different aspects
of human nature. This course will serve its purpose if it fosters an appreciation
for philosophical thought, respect for the thinkers we will study, and
the desire to apply the skills and ideas learned to the area of ethics.&nbsp;
<p>The questions we will address include: Is there such a thing as truth?
Do human beings have a specific nature? Are human beings free? Do human
beings have a soul?&nbsp; If so, could the human soul be immortal? Are
human beings merely a sum of physical parts and processes? Every member
of this class should leave this semester&nbsp;
<br>with the wherewithal to provide intelligent responses to these important
philosophical questions.&nbsp;
<p>Our readings will be drawn from the works of some great figures in the
history of thought. Most of the readings are not lengthy, but they are
challenging. The positions of the philosophers we will read deserve serious
thought and reflection. It is expected that every student will take the
time to read and think about every assigned reading prior to each meeting.
It is also expected that every student read each piece of material at least
twice.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#000099"><font size=+2>Course Requirements</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(1) <b>Exams</b>: The mid-term and final will be comprised of essay
and objective questions.&nbsp; You will be asked to choose from two essay
questions.&nbsp; You will also be given several true/false, short answer,
and multiple choice questions. The first exam is worth 15% of your final
grade; the second is worth 15%.&nbsp;
<p>(2)<b> Papers</b>: There are two short papers required for this course.
Papers should be about 3 (double spaced) pages in length. Written assignments
are intended to provide an opportunity for you to present and assess an
argument.&nbsp; Organization will be weighed heavily, and grammar will
count. Each paper will be worth 15% of&nbsp;
<br>your final grade.&nbsp;
<p>(3) <b>Class participation</b>: Students are generally&nbsp; unable
to perform well in this course unless they engage themselves in the readings
and discussions.&nbsp; This course will be primarily based upon class discussion
and Internet participation. In addition, there will be ten 5-question quizzes
pertaining to logic and the&nbsp;
<br>reading assignments. Participation is worth 20% of your grade (10%
in class-- regular contributions; 10% electronic-- 2 postings per week);&nbsp;
quizzes are worth 10%.&nbsp; Assignments are worth 10% of your final grade.&nbsp;
