<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Gettier’s 
Argument:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">1) If (a) and 
(b), then there are cases in which one could have justified true belief without 
knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">2) If there are 
cases in which one could have justified true belief without knowledge, then 
justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">3) (a) and (b)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">4) Therefore, 
justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in"><i>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Explanation 
of the premises:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Premise (1) is a 
conditional whose truth rests on the two cases that Gettier presents.&nbsp; In each 
of the two cases, Smith begins with a belief he is justified in holding and 
deduces another proposition from the initial justified belief.&nbsp; Due to unusual 
circumstances in both cases, each of the initial beliefs turns out to be false, 
but the entailed beliefs are true for reasons Smith does not know.&nbsp; If (a) and 
(b) hold, Smith has justified true belief of a different proposition in each 
case, but he does not know either proposition.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The truth of 
premise (2) depends on what it means to be a sufficient condition.&nbsp; The three 
criteria from the classical account of knowledge from Plato—truth, 
justification, and belief—have been assumed by many to define knowledge.&nbsp; If 
this is so, then these three criteria when taken together are sufficient for 
knowledge.&nbsp; But if there are situations in which one could have a justified true 
belief without knowledge, then these conditions are not sufficient for 
knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Premise three 
involves two principles that function as presuppositions in the argument. (a) 
seems to be justified easily.&nbsp; I can believe with justification that I will be 
in this room in one minute, and that could turn out to be false.&nbsp; Countless 
other examples support this principle.&nbsp; (b) has a lot of intuitive support.&nbsp; If 
I am justified in believing that my name is “Winter”, and I see that this 
implies that I have I name, then I am justified in believing that I have a name.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Critique:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">To reject 
Gettier’s argument, which seems fishy in some way, one much either identify a 
false premise or show that the conclusion does not follow from the premises.&nbsp; 
The conclusion does indeed follow.&nbsp; Which premise is false?&nbsp; It is hard to say, 
but I think (b) in premise (3) is most vulnerable.&nbsp; Consider this example.&nbsp; I am 
justified in believing that UST is a university and this implies any and every 
necessary truth.&nbsp; Take some complicated mathematical truth, t.&nbsp; Even though I 
can barely understand t, my belief about UST entails it, and therefore by (b) I 
am justified in believing t.&nbsp; This might be problematic.</span></p>
